R24FH41D7G9LJN,Facts instead of hysteria,"I approached this book with more than a little trepidation. I read all the 1 star reviews, I watched an Indigenous elder on TV emotionally describing the book as being filled with ""racism and hatred"", I researched the organization that published it. I had no desire to read or support some crazy alt-right conspiracy-laden rant. Despite my caution, I needed to try and get another side of the IRS story, as I have been deeply troubled by the events of the last three years, by having my parents, grandparents and their whole generation accused and convicted of ""genocide"" without any proof being offered, just ""anomalies"" and shocking stories. This book offered a breath of fresh air, a confirmation that others share my concern. There is not one whiff of racism or hatred in this book that I could find. It is a well researched (there is barely a paragraph in it that does not contain a footnote with references) and calmly argued investigation into the wild claims that have been made about the Indian Residential School system. Much of the hysteria I have heard on the news in the past three years reminds me of the ""satanic cult"" daycare scandals of the 80's and 90's - lives and reputations ruined based just on wild claims with no evidence. ""Believe the Children!"" they said at the time...well children sometimes tell stories, especially when ""encouraged"". Grave Error in no way denies that in a system like the IRS there were bound to be some abuses and mismanagement, but this is true of any large institution in that day and age (British boarding schools, Irish orphanages etc). The IRS system was certainly not perfect, but that doesn't make it ""genocidal"". I found the book treats Indigenous people and their culture with respect and sensitivity, but it doesn't let that keep it from presenting cold, hard facts. If anyone finds racism or hatred in this book, it is because they need to find it, whether it is there or not. I will say that the book is a bit bloated - each chapter is written by a different author and it can be repetitive in its presentation of facts and could have done with a better editing job to tighten it up. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed it and it highly recommend it - don't be scared to read it, you should be skeptical about most of what you have heard about this book, just like most of what you have heard about ""mass graves"" and ""genocide"".","<span>I approached this book with more than a little trepidation.

It challenges many of the stories currently in circulation, particularly after the Kamloops IRS “revelations”. Almost all the claims do not stand up to the scrutiny given here. What is difficult to absorb about this work, which is far ahead of the current popular view, is that it is so different from what most people have been led to believe. Is it accurate? Have we been had? It sure looks that way. While many authors here are on the “conservative” side of the political spectrum, and the publisher is obviously of that persuasion also, don’t let that deter you if you are a progressive. If you’ve been skeptical of some claims, or the cancelling of Canada Day, the lowering of flags, the hostility of debates, the political posturing, you will find this book confirming and shocking. I would have liked to have seen a couple articles in this collection supporting the “mass graves narrative”, assuming credible evidence was provided. But maybe it wouldn’t be convincing placed beside these essays. This is a very important book. Read it and spread it around. I hope many Indigenous people read this and consider pushing back against some leaders who may be misleading their bands.

I belonged to the Boy Scouts, a blessing to boys in a grim, mediocre school system. One thing I really benefited from was when our Scout Master arranged with the Scout Master of an Indian residential school on a reserve south of our town to have us more senior boys of both troops get together to do scouting activities in their marvelously unblemished woodlands. We really bonded as fellow scouts. They seemed to really like their life at the residential school, which seemed a very nice setting. I think it was an Anglican Church school. School brutality did exist, at least at my school. Both the principal and vice-principal in elementary school (grade 7 and 8) whacked and roughed up the boys quite frequently. The worst incident was when our woman teacher in grade 5 attacked young Melvin with a steel-edged ruler, drawing blood by nearly gouging out his eye. His immigrant parents were afraid to complain.

RHTDJEWPVBADS,What ever happened to evidence based decision making?,"I am not a Conservative, nor am I a fan of Conrad Black, who wrote the introduction to this book, or of Tom Flannigan who contributed to it. However, I purchased this book in the hope that it could shed a light on some of the questions I had concerning the recent moral panic regarding the soil disturbances found around some Residential Schools, Churches and Hospitals in Canada. I say moral panic because that is what it was and still is unfortunately. Without a shred of evidence, not a single body recovered, Canadians assumed the worst and as the days progressed the stories grew more and more macabre. Our Prime Minister had photo ops taken looking sorrowful as he clutched a teddy bear, First Nations were saying ""see, I told you so!"", money was dispensed and Canada willingly bore the shame of being a genocidal nation for all the world to see. It has become equivalent to the ""Satanic Panic"" of the 1980's. We have turned Residential Schools into Canada's own Tuol Sleng. Yet, not a single forensic study has been made. Not a single body has been exhumed and now the topic has become so taboo that we cannot even have a frank and open discussion about it for fear of being called a ""Denier"". Or protestors outside our homes. How does this happen? How does this fit with the ""evidence based decision making"" once promoted by our Government? If this is the current zeitgeist in which we live then I am fearful for our Nation.  This book does not deny the existence of Residential Schools, as many people who appear not to have read it wish to say. It only states, through a collection of essays, that there is an absence of evidence for some of the claims being made regarding the soil disturbances detected by ground penetrating radar.  We need this book. We need to be able to debate this topic because extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. And evidence, not hearsay, must be presented before reconciliation can occur.","<span>I am not a Conservative, nor am I a fan of Conrad Black, who wrote the introduction to this book, or of Tom Flannigan who contributed to it. However, I purchased this book in the hope that it could shed a light on some of the questions I had concerning the recent moral panic regarding the soil disturbances found around some Residential Schools, Churches and Hospitals in Canada. I say moral panic because that is what it was and still is unfortunately. Without a shred of evidence, not a single body recovered, Canadians assumed the worst and as the days progressed the stories grew more and more macabre. Our Prime Minister had photo ops taken looking sorrowful as he clutched a teddy bear, First Nations were saying ""see, I told you so!"", money was dispensed and Canada willingly bore the shame of being a genocidal nation for all the world to see. It has become equivalent to the ""Satanic Panic"" of the 1980's. We have turned Residential Schools into Canada's own Tuol Sleng. Yet, not a single forensic study has been made. Not a single body has been exhumed and now the topic has become so taboo that we cannot even have a frank and open discussion about it for fear of being called a ""Denier"". Or protestors outside our homes. How does this happen? How does this fit with the ""evidence based decision making"" once promoted by our Government? If this is the current zeitgeist in which we live then I am fearful for our Nation.<br><br>This book does not deny the existence of Residential Schools, as many people who appear not to have read it wish to say. It only states, through a collection of essays, that there is an absence of evidence for some of the claims being made regarding the soil disturbances detected by ground penetrating radar.<br><br>We need this book.

R7PRJCOURSYIG,This Ivory Tower Book is not the Whole Story,"I purchased this book because I was curious on how the learned professors from our esteemed Universities would frame this chapter of Canada's history. Also, I was curious about their research that would explain why there was no RCMP or Coroner's investigation into the mass grave site at KIB after more than 2 years had gone by since the discovery.  After finishing this book, I felt like this book was Swiss cheese with so many gaps. Had anyone of these writers even visited a Rez? Because they came off as Ottawa-centered!  I have lived in Kamloops and the South Okanagan for most of my life and have a first hand deep understanding of the issues of our neighbours on the Rez from the generational trauma that the residential school system brought to their families. They were raised outside of a family unit and when it was time to have families, there was no role modelling on how to be a parent because they were not raised by by loving parents themselves. As well with all traumatized humans, self medicating became rampant. This is not addressed in the book.  Neither is addressed the lack of freedom at that time to leave the reserves without permission, no access to the court system, or not having the right to vote in federal elections. There was no mention in this book that a delegation from South Africa visited Canada to assess the reservation system and based their Apartheid system on what we had set up here. That is a big gap to leave out!  During Christmas of 1947, a letter went out from the Kamloops Residential school to the parents informing them that the students would be NOT be coming home for Christmas that year because the students overstayed with their parents the previous Christmas. This was punitive and keeping the children away from the parents only because they didn't return after the holidays on the exact date expected. These sort of facts and stories are not included in the essays in this book.  Please read this book to actually see what systemic rascism actually looks like! The road to hell is paved with good intentions, right?!

R1GAVWSDAYBIQJ,Good but not as good as the first for me,"📚BOOK REVIEW📚  “The Housemaid’s Secret” Author: @fmcfaddenauthor ⭐️⭐️⭐️  ✨“This perfect house has one rule. Don’t look behind closed doors.”✨  I have been anxiously awaiting this sequel to “The Housemaid” wondering what Millie is going to get up to next! So let’s dive in!  The book starts out with a time jump, and we find our Millie is a nanny to a rich couple. Very quickly we find out that the baby she has been helping to watch along side her cleaning duties starts calling her Mama (as Millie spends more time with baby, Olive, than her actual mother Amber does) and she quickly gets fired by the jealous child’s mother for this offence.

R13UU6H5VJR15J,Feed your pets what you yourself would eat,"I pre-ordered this books several months ago and just could not wait to receive it. For years we were led to believe that kibbles contained everything a dog needed to stay healthy and prosper. As time went on I turned to raw food for the first meal of the day followed by kibbles at night. Even though I knew I was meeting their needs everything looked really plain and boring so I started adding little toppers. We've been told what we should and should not feed our pets for so long that it's absolutely mind boggling to find out that a lot of this was completely wrong. I'm so excited to be able to offer my 2 girls appetizing and varied meals. No more eating the same old, same old everyday. I haven't gotten very far reading the book yet because there are so many things I need to add to my grocery list that it keeps interrupting me. I can't wait to start offering them what they deserve to be fed.  My recommendation - buy this book and treat your pets like the valued members of the family they truly are. You won't regret it and neither will they.","<span>I pre-ordered this books several months ago and just could not wait to receive it.

R20AY40ZETQ0IZ,chef's kiss 5/5 <3,"**SPOILER  ACOTAR This was my first fantasy romance series, and OMG I’m hooked. Was I confused the entire time, yes, but that didn’t stop me from eating this up bc everything made sense at the end. I don't like the Beauty and Beast trope, but those last 100 pages were incredible. Tamlin wearing a mask, I got the ick. I couldn’t solve the riddle either, don’t worry Feyre.  ACOMAF I laughed, I cried. I was mad, then happy. WOW ACOMAF came and just flipped my whole world around. I was up till 5am reading. Feyre changed bc of what she went through under the mountain, but so did Tamlin, and because they are both struggling with their own separate traumas neither can communicate what they need from each other. The relationship became unhealthy and no longer compatible. There was a ton of additional world building and character introductions that I was just not prepared for. Feyre’s character development, incredible. Rhys brings out the best in Feyre, always treating her as an equal with autonomy and her own choices. Rhys has that dark edge, charm, wit and humour, but you also get to see his vulnerabilities, his huge capacity to love and found family of the Inner Circle. Also I love how SJM writes every character as the most beautiful. Despite a seemingly 'happily ever after ending,' the horrors of the end !!! The cliff hanger is making me need to read the third book ASAP.  ACOWAR I loveddddd the politics in this one! I’m so obsessed with this series. I was loaning the books out from the Library and after reading this buckled down bought the entire series knowing I was going to be re-reading this. There were so many tiny small details from ACOTAR that come back in ACOWAR. The last 100 pages are like being in a tornado of emotions - sad, happy, joy, anger, understanding, forgiveness, hope etc TBH, I kinda wish someone actually died in the battle :/ but SJM loves a ‘happily ever after’ ending after all.  ACOFAS I read this novella in 1 sitting. She’s small, but she throws punches! I really liked the domestic story and all the POVs. But they say “mate” 20 million times. I’m patiently waiting for the next part of the series: Nesta, Elain, Lucien, Cassian and Azriel. I really hope that Nesta and Elaine’s mates are not Cassian and Azriel tho. That would be too cliche if the 3 sisters were mated to the 3 Night Court warriors. SJM needs her happy ending. The sneak peak at the next book is, chefs kiss :* but seriously ofc Nesta and Cassian get together.  ACOSF There are drugs in this, and I couldn’t stop reading all 750 pages. I had to put this book down so many time and just stay silent with my thoughts. Cassian’s passion to train the women to fight back against anyone who attempt to hurt them like they had his mother, and Nesta still feeling nothing after having been Made against her will… woah it broke my heart. Nesta character development INCREDIBLE. She constantly was taking steps forward, but back tracking. The friendship with the House, yes. Building her found family of Gwen and Emrie, amazing. Her internal battle for her own self-worth is heartbreaking and inspiring all at once. I kinda hate how Rhys didn’t tell Feyre about the pregnancy scare and health risks… like this dude for 3 books (plus 1 novella) always gave Feyre autonomy and choices of what to do, and he took that away from her. It’s a no from me.","<span>**SPOILER<br><br>ACOTAR<br>This was my first fantasy romance series, and OMG I’m hooked.

R2B0OBCCPKFSKD,A story for the years.,"I remember looking at it from afar while browsing my favourite bookshop. The bright pink cover got my attention, but it wasn't until the next visit that I decided to pick it up. I didn't get past the first chapters, but months later, I tried again, pushed through it, and found myself unable to put it down.  I rushed through the rest of the series, and in less than a week, I was left staring at my ceiling, wondering why I had ever stopped reading. This series reminded me of what I love about books and a good story: the thrill, the sadness, the relatability of certain characters and the incredible bliss that comes with losing oneself in faraway worlds.

R2RKMFMKPRY26M,A masterpiece in pages,"“The Lost Bookshop”, is pure gold, a masterpiece that implements the here and now into the magical forces of the other world, a world beyond reality. What a glorious book! It’s a story that weaves together three extraordinary, charming and peculiar characters in Opaline, Martha and Henry, each striving to write their own stories or to simply find them. Either way, this book is hypnotic in its prose, it takes fictional writing to a whole new level for those who truly love books. It is an enchanting illustration in a world where books are fundamentally important, playing a pivotal role for those who choose to hold those majestic gems in their hands. When a book whispers, you listen intently to what it has to say. This book speaks volumes, it absolutely peaked my curiosity, it was definitely a page turner and it was so hard to put it down. I basically plowed through it full steam ahead, like I was under some type of hypnotic spell compelling me to read on.  Life can cause individuals to view their own lives from the sidelines, not fully engaged within the confines of what life has to offer. It goes without saying that at times we all need a Madame Bowden in our lives just to add clarification to the things we don’t yet fully comprehend, a unique wizard of sorts who has the power to unlock secrets just sitting on a shelf. This vanishing bookshop has something to offer both Martha and Henry, they just need to conjure up the confidence to read between the lines and to see what cannot be seen, the author magically intertwines Opaline’s past life with the present. It’s pure genius, a fantastical journey where something lost can eventually be found if you stay on the majestical current path.  This book adhered the conforming gender roles during Opaline’s storyline, a time when women were viewed as the weaker sex and therefore not taken seriously at all. Women had voices, but were never heard. It is noted that women writers used pseudonyms when writing back in the day, otherwise they wouldn’t get published as efficiently. Author Evie Gaughan used pseudonym Evie Woods at the author of this particular book, just to drive that point home.  This novel incorporates great classic books, manuscripts and its authors into its storyline, and I liked that Sylvia Beach and her bookshop Shakespeare & Company were included as I read and enjoyed “The Paris Bookseller”. I am compelled to mention the cover, the concept brilliantly designed. My book was on my coffee table and the lights from the television changed the colour of the leaves on the front cover, the leaves twinkled with different shades, it was magical just as its content is.  This novel will take the reader to a place of mystical magic with a dash of myth and I highly recommend it. Evie Woods lives Ireland and has created the most amazing book using her magical mind. It’s an intricately woven story with two vivid timelines that will burrow its way into your heart.  LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️","<span>“The Lost Bookshop”, is pure gold, a masterpiece that implements the here and now into the magical forces of the other world, a world beyond reality.

Greene's laws range from the strategic and cunning to the ruthless and manipulative, offering readers a glimpse into the darker aspects of human behavior.  Central to Greene's philosophy is the idea that power is a fundamental aspect of human society, and those who understand its dynamics are better equipped to navigate the complexities of social and professional life. Through his laws, he offers practical advice on how to wield power effectively, whether in personal relationships, business dealings, or political arenas.  Moreover, ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is filled with compelling anecdotes and historical examples that illustrate each law in action. From the cunning tactics of Machiavelli to the strategic maneuvers of Napoleon, Greene draws on a wide range of sources to demonstrate the timeless principles of power and influence.  However, it's important to note that some readers may find Greene's approach to be Machiavellian or morally dubious. While the book offers valuable insights into human psychology and social dynamics, some of the tactics described may be seen as manipulative or unethical. As such, readers should approach the text with a critical eye and consider the implications of applying its principles in their own lives.  In conclusion, ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is a provocative and compelling read that offers valuable insights into the nature of power and influence. Whether viewed as a Machiavellian handbook or a pragmatic guide to success, Greene's laws provide a fascinating glimpse into the dynamics of human behavior and the pursuit of power.","<span>The 48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene is a controversial and thought-provoking exploration of the dynamics of power and influence.

R3JPP7JNSBUMTX,"Heart-breaking, emotional and thought-provoking!","This is my first read by this author and I was impressed with the heart-breaking, emotional and, apparently, real-life story of two couples both trying to have a family through the IVF process in Australia. There is a devastating conundrum within the Empona Clinic which leads to an eventual court case, leaving readers struggling with their loyalties to both couples, and I actually felt empathy towards the female judge. Although I liked both couples - none of them was perfect, with all of them showing deception in various ways. Nick and Priya who were separated during a good part of the story became reunited prior to the court case, but that situation didn't seem to be used greatly in deciding the case one way or another.  I gave this book a 4-star because it certainly held my interest, it was a roller-coaster of a story, but I felt there were full chapters in the story which seemed somewhat redundant, e.g. the story of Martin and Leslie Crawford, the various trips by Dr. Ashley Li and by Grace and Dan near the end and some of the details on Priya's life while living alone. I know some of it is to flush out the characters' personalities a bit but I wanted to get on with the story and come to a satisfactory ending. I did have a question that I would like to ask the author about a certain little blond haired girl, but I don't want to put in spoilers. I also thought the story didn't fully present the terrible emotional trauma that is experienced in any pregnancy loss, whether through normal processes or IVF processes, and felt that the author didn't have enough experience or didn't do enough interviewing to get the full and deep emotional devastion that is felt.  Overall, an interesting read that kept me up late at night reading, gave me some thought-provoking periods, some tears and even a smile from time to time.","<span>This is my first read by this author and I was impressed with the heart-breaking, emotional and, apparently, real-life story of two couples both trying to have a family through the IVF process in Australia.

I can't wait to get it back from him and my mom. For $9, This book is fun for my dad to fill out with my mom as they reminisce over the questions and it will be something I will treasure for the rest of my days. When I receive it I'm going to print photocopy every page to send a set to my brothers and sister. On Facebook they are promoting something called my story for about a $100.

Don't hesitate to purchase this book, regardless of your relationship with your parent.

RN2MB8DW0CLFO,Keeps the brain sharp!!,"This is a great workbook to review concepts learned during the school year. I purchased this book for my child to use during the summer to keep his mind sharp. He does a couple of pages each day, and is done! The books are wonderful for helping students retain information that is often lost during summer break. My son likes that he isn't sitting for long periods of time doing work, so it still feels like summer break vs school! Once in a while I'll catch him doing more pages, or doing some another time of the day.  I have purchased other workbooks from stores, and the kids have no interest in them. The Summer Bridge books hold their attention, which is something I find positive. I also like that the book mixes concepts, so my child isn't only doing math, writing, etc. They change it up a bit, which plays a big part in holding interest. The book also comes with flash cards, stickers, and a certificate when they complete the pages. I would not use the books as a sole teaching tool, but it is great for supplementing during the school year, or for school breaks (like we are doing).I would definitely buy these again, as my children progress.","<span>This is a great workbook to review concepts learned during the school year.

R2U5A2L6BTY0LB,A manageable addition to your summer routine to keep skills fresh.,"I've gotten these books for my son every summer for the last 3 or 4 years. He hates them!

R213CL3BW9Q1B3,Loved it,"Pretty sure I’m still on the verge of tears while writing this, and that’s because of how emotionally invested I was in the relationship. Jimenez is so skilled at writing these playful, chemistry-filled romances that make me smile one minute and have a churning in my gut the next. This one really put me through my paces emotionally, with these gorgeous, sunshiney moments juxtaposed with an undercurrent of heartache and pain. These two fell for each other in such an effortless way, even though that was never the plan. Our sweetheart of a hero was swooning from the start, and I LOVED how adorably smitten he was. So freaking adorable, this man. Our black cat heroine put up a good fight, but she didn’t stand a chance against him. The relationship was bright and easy, which contrasted perfectly with the chaos swirling around them both. Neither was in the right headspace to fall in love, but it found them anyways - even though the road to HEA was filled with landmines. Such a compelling and complex read, EASILY my new favorite from the author.  The story follows Emma, a woman who is constantly on the move. She didn’t have the best childhood, so she prefers to take temporary jobs and travel around the country with her best friend. One day, Emma reads an AITA post and relates to the guy - every time he dates someone, the next person they meet ends up being their soulmate. The same thing seems to happen to Emma every time, so the two bond over DMs and text messages. It’s not long before Emma and Justin make a plan - they’ll go on a few dates with each other and break both of their dating curses. But once they meet face-to-face, that plan begins to crumble. Not only do they get along way better than either could’ve anticipated, but keeping things fun and easy is impossible to do when both of their messy families get involved. Soon, Justin and Emma are falling for each other in a very real way, which could cause trouble for them both.  I loved the concept of two strangers who bond over DMs and messages before connecting in person, and the epistolary element was great. Justin and Emma both know they’re not in the right headspace for something real, but that’s not what they ever intended to be for each other. Their relationship developed so naturally, and it was easy to see how perfect they were for each other. I was laughing, smiling, and swooning right along with them, especially since Justin is such a fantastic man. He’s so steady and cuddly and adorable, even though he’s barely keeping his head above water. It’s definitely a case of meeting the right person at the absolute worst time, which ratchets up the tension in a major way. Emma is such a complicated character, but I loved her too. After six books, I’m never surprised when Jimenez emotionally devastates me with her twists and turns, but I was still taken aback by how much it hurt this time. It’s not a story I’ll be forgetting anytime soon, it’s both entertaining and impactful. I loved it!  Audio note: The audio is fabulous, highly recommended in the format! The epistolary element at the beginning is almost duet-style, so I had my fingers crossed that it would be that way throughout (it’s not), but both narrators give excellent, emotive performances. I’m not familiar with Christine Laken, but I loved her voice and the emotion she was able to infuse into the story. There were a couple of instances where it was difficult to tell who she was voicing, but that would be my only complaint. This is the best I’ve ever heard Zachary Webber, he gives an incredibly strong performance. The runtime (11-12 hours) was just slightly more than I could get through in a single day, but I could not wait to dive back in. There’s a very minimal amount of spice, so no worries there if you plan to listen at work - just be aware that you might start crying at any time, lol. All in all, I’m very glad I was able to experience the story in that format.","<span>Pretty sure I’m still on the verge of tears while writing this, and that’s because of how emotionally invested I was in the relationship.

RSCCA95AMRRTO,"""Always choose empathy""","""The best kind of love doesn't happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life.”  Another fabulous, unique, slowburn RomCom from Abby Jimenez set at a summer cottage on the lake, full of insightful depth and emotions and just the right amount of spice!  I’m a huge fan of Abby’s writing style and how well she develops her characters in all her books. This book was no different. Emma, the FMC, has a fear of long term commitment due to childhood trauma. Her character wasn’t easy to connect with at the beginning but I feel like it was written this way to show how hard it was for her to connect and trust people. As the story unfolds it is easier to understand why the traveling nurse is slow to trust and has a fear of long term commitments. I loved Emma’s best friend Maddy and her no nonsense, overprotective but hilarious personality. Then there’s Justin…a perfect selfless gentleman/boyfriend who isn’t afraid of a commitment, no matter the cost. He is resilient and always puts everyone else’s needs before his own.  I appreciate that Abby isn’t afraid to include the topic of mental health and trauma in her books. The layers of emotion and trauma are raw, but realistic, and are presented in an accurate but sensitive way. She shows the effects that trauma has on relationships are real and not something to take lightly. There are some heavy topics and complex family dynamics but there’s also found family, which is always uplifting and heartwarming.  This is the third book in the Part of Your World series. I suggest reading them in order so you can catch all the Easter eggs hidden within this book but you could definitely read it as a standalone as well. Don’t skip over the Q&A with the author at the end of the book, it is very insightful.","<span>""The best kind of love doesn't happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations.

R3BTBC7OWAQM2V,Captivating Characters and Seamless Storytelling: A Review of 'Just for the Summer' by Abby Jimenez,"""Just for the Summer"" by Abby Jimenez captivated me from start to finish, earning its place as one of the best stories I've ever read. Emma and Justin's characters were so compelling, which is rare for me as I don't easily connect with heroines in books. Their struggles were portrayed with such depth that it added a wonderful layer of conflict to the narrative.  I particularly enjoyed the incorporation of the Reddit post, which added a hilarious and authentic touch. The recurring question of ""Am I the A-hole?"" provided a delightful comic element throughout the story. Jimenez's storytelling prowess truly shines here, seamlessly blending humor with moments that evoked genuine tears from me.  What struck me most was the seamless connection to the first book, ""Part of Your World."" It prompted me to revisit the earlier story, realizing how much I had forgotten. Upon rereading both books, I found myself even more enamored with ""Just for the Summer.""  Our international book club had a riveting discussion about the characters, particularly Amber, whose complexity led us to ponder whether she was a narcissist, bipolar, or a blend of both. The depth and believability of the characters sparked conversations as if they were real individuals rather than fictional creations.  Experiencing the book through both Kindle and Audible, narrated by Christine Lakin and Zachary Weber, was a treat. Both narrators brought the story to life with their exceptional talent, enhancing the overall experience.  I wholeheartedly recommend any book penned by Abby Jimenez. Her storytelling prowess and ability to craft multidimensional characters make her a must-read author for me.","<span>""Just for the Summer"" by Abby Jimenez captivated me from start to finish, earning its place as one of the best stories I've ever read.

R8X0B2CSSM2HA,"A Wonderful, Heartfelt Love Story","Emma and Justin are cursed. Every time each of them dates someone else that person finds their soulmate immediately after. After Justin writes a thread on Reddit, the two of them find each other and decide to date each other in hopes they will both find their own soulmates. What they don't expect is to be drawn to each other more than they ever thought possible. After meeting, they both go through their own family hardships, and luckily they are both there to help each other out in ways they never imagined.  I LOVED this book and could not put down. I fell in love with both of the characters, especially Justin who is just too good to be true (my favorite in a book). I laughed and I cried. It was a wonderful, heartfelt story that has a sweet love story, but also hardships for people with mental health problems. I thought it was very well-written and I was never bored. I did find out that it goes with two other books and I think I would have liked to read them first but did not seem to miss them while reading this story. If you love a good story about two characters who have a rough life but find each other, then this is the book for you! I highly recommend!","<span>Emma and Justin are cursed.

R2K3ZGKOUGXCLP,Beautifully written,"""You're not asking for too much. You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.""  This book was another win for me by Abby! It was beautiful! This book is about healing from the trauma that is placed on you by others. And is it worth letting those people stay in your life if you're constanting having to put yourself back together after the damage they cause over and over again! So much of this book I could relate to! Which hit so hard! I'm always so grateful for writers like Abby, who put words to emotions I've never been able to!  ☀️  Justin and Emma struggle with the same curse. Whoever they date, the next person they date falls in love with their soul mate!  Emma was used to running. Never putting down roots so she never had to lose anything. So when Justin offers a deal to break their curse together, she agrees, knowing it'll only be temporary. Because temporary she could do. Temporary was her normal!  But Emma wasn't expecting to find a safe place in Justin. And that was scarier than she could have ever imagined. But slowly, Justin shows her what it was like to have someone who is constant and what it feels like to be wanted.  ☀️  A few of my favorite parts: (I tried very hard not to include spoilers but read with caution or dont)  -Justin was such an overthinker, and I loved it!-  “I’m thinking that I like you a lot more than I thought I would. I’m thinking that I probably smell because it’s hot and all my deodorant washed off in the pool, and that this place would be the perfect place to kiss you like I’m supposed to, but I wouldn’t because of the deodorant thing. I’m thinking that this whole thing with your mom and Neil feels weird, and I can’t put my finger on why. I’m thinking that I don’t like her because she’s ignoring you for some guy she just met, and I feel bad that I don’t like her because I know you do. And then I’m wondering if I’m too hard on people, because I can’t stop thinking about what you said earlier, that you should always choose empathy, and if you can choose empathy with someone like that, I should be able to do it with people I love—but I can’t. I’m thinking your bathing suit looks too tight, and it looks uncomfortable like it’s going to leave lines on your skin. I’m thinking about what those lines would look like when you take it off—not in a sexual way, but also sort of in a sexual way.” I felt my face starting to heat up a little. “Aaaaand now I’m wondering if I’ve said too much and what you’re thinking.”  -His surveys were one of my favorite parts of the book. It was perfectly nerdy, and I loved it!‐  ""1. On a scale from Awkward to Charming, how would you rate Justin’s performance?""  -Everyone needs a friend like Maddy! She loved Emma so fiercely. And always knew exactly how to handle her when she fell apart. Even if she didn't agree with the way Emma handled a situation, she was always there to pick her up in the end.-  ""Has Maddy ever killed anyone?"" She pretended to think about it. ""Nobody I can prove."" I was cracking up at her threatening him.  “I want you to know that your empathy is beautiful, Emma. I hope you never lose that. I do hope that one day you get some boundaries though.”  -Emma's relationship with her mom was heartbreaking!-  ""So I became an island-and the island is small. I don't need anyone. And I know that sounds sort of terrible, but it's actualy comforting to know that I have this ability to need no one. It feels like a superpower. Like I'm untouchable.""  -I loved Justin's mothers relationship with her best friend, Leigh. Abby always does such an incredible job with her side characters. Not only do you connect with her main characters. But her aide characters are always wonderful!‐  “Emma, you want to hold one?” Mom asked. She gasped. “Yes!” A hand emerged from the back seat with a tiny chittering raccoon in it wrapped in a bar towel. “This is George Cooney.” Emma took it and held it to her chest and looked at me with hearts in her eyes. “Look at his little hands!”  -There are just so many beautiful parts of this book! But one of my favorite qoutes were....  “Unhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks. You don’t know how broken she was or what she was trying to do to fill those cracks. Being broken is not an excuse for bad behavior, you still have to make good choices and do the right thing. But it can be the reason. And sometimes understanding the reason can be what helps you heal.”  ""The best kind of love doesn’t happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It’s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about.""  -I usually am dreading Abby's 3rd act breakups! But this time I loved it. The growth that came from it was so needed and the book wouldn't have been the same without it. Was it heartbreaking to read? 1000% But this time it was as beautiful as it was heartbreaking!-  -AND I CANT FORGET THE EASTER EGGS!! I have to admit I didn't see any of those twists coming. But to see that come full circle was pretty cool!  I also listened to the audio after reading the book and it was an incredible performance by Chrstine Lakin and Zachary Webber!! They were the perfect voices for these two characters!","<span>""You're not asking for too much. You were just asking the wrong person.

RFSN138147SCS,An easy 5 star read and will be one of my top favorite reads of 2024!,"Absolutely loved loved loved! I devoured this book, and although I kept trying to pace myself so it would last longer, I ended up finishing it in less than 24 hours, because I just couldn't put it down! An easy 5 star read for me and I have no doubt it'll be one of my top favorite books of 2024!  I was excited about this book's release thinking that I would like it, but I was not expecting to love it as much as I did! My favorite Abby Jimenez book by far! It was absolute perfection. I mean we have a gardening loving, travel nurse as our female main character then we throw in a dash of magical realism?! Are you kidding me? If that book isn't meant for me than I don't know what is! 😂  One of my major conditions on how much I love a rom-com is how it makes me feel while reading it. If the book is giving me butterflies, heart-dropping angst, and making me kick my legs because I am so giddy, then it's 5 star perfection and this, my friends, gave me all of this and more.  The characters were absolutely perfect. As I mentioned earlier, Emma was a FMC of my dreams, but then we get the MMC, Justin, who was just as perfect. From page one, I was hooked and was pleasantly surprised to see what this storyline was all about. Both characters believe their love lives to be cursed. After dating someone and breaking up with them that person always meets the love of their life right after. Discovering one another through a Reddit thread and both sharing the same dilemma, Emma and Justin decide to date for a short period of time to cancel out each other's curse. And well, we all know where this is going. 😉  Another thing I loved and what I really appreciated the author gave us is a believable third act conflict. We all know when picking up a romance, we are getting one. Unfortunately, sometimes they can really mess the flow up for me while reading, because at times they don't feel natural, or they are just plain silly like the dreaded miscommunication trope, which is guaranteed to make my eyes roll. I was so pleasantly surprised we didn't get one of those and instead got a great segue into how the book concludes. 🙌  This is a standalone novel in case anyone was wondering. Abby gives us lots of Easter eggs and it was fun to read her thought process at the end of why she included what. But luckily you don't have to read any of her previous books to enjoy this one and in my opinion, they weren't too spoiler-y.  Overall, and I can't stress this enough I loved it and can't recommend it enough. I feel it would be a slam dunk winner for anyone who decides to pick it up!","<span>Absolutely loved loved loved!

Ask me instead.”  Abby has done it again! This book was everything I expected and more.  First of all, even though this book can be read as a standalone, I would highly recommend reading Part of Your World and Yours Truly first to understand some of the events/characters that take place in this one. Specifically Part of Your World as the big shocker in the end is connected.  Now on to this review! Justin and Emma meet online through a Reddit post as both characters connect over their unfortunate bad luck in love. You see… every time they date someone and they break up, the exes move on to find the love of their lives. Through a mutual pact, they both agree to date each other and “break” their curse. The rules… four dates, one kiss, and a breakup. Not complicated at all, right?  I loved this book! The amount of meaningful quotes and laugh-out-loud moments had me eating the pages. Justin has become a favorite MMC! His ideas for the dates, his surveys, his special moments with Emma, and his love for his family were admirable. This book also handles trauma, a toxic parent, and new guardianship. Abby did a great job navigating the not-so-happy moments on the page as well. Loved Maddie and her unwavering support for Emma.  “You can love someone and still not be willing to give up your way of life for them. And then there are those you love who you’d take a bullet for. It’s all the same emotion, just different levels.”  If you are looking for your next book, pick up Abby.

RIFOAEMSMGMH,"Five brilliant, sparkling stars","I love Abby Jimenez so much, and after every new book of hers, I wish I could read it again for the first time. She's an absolutely delightful human being, and I'm so lucky to have met her in person.  Just for the Summer is a fun romantic romp with surprising depth. (Well, if you know Abby's writing, it really *isn't* surprising, but you know what I mean.) Justin and Emma both suffer from the same curse--they're the person people date RIGHT BEFORE the other person finds their soulmate. So in an attempt to break the curse, they agree to date--just for the summer--so that they both then can go on to find the person they're meant to be with. Only things don't exactly go according to plan. Instead of keeping things surface level, things quickly get serious between the two. Suddenly, a relationship with an end-date isn't what either one of them really want.  Now--where's the depth, you ask? Trauma. Trauma. And more trauma. Emma survived the foster care system after her flighty, inconstant mother abandoned her one too many times. She has attachment issues, and she keeps her heart completely walled off. Justin is suddenly the legal guardian for his three younger siblings because his mother is serving time in prison for embezzlement. He has a lot on his plate, and falling in love wasn't part of the plan. But--thankfully--plans can change, and therapy can help even the most broken people begin to heal. Oh--and seriously, each book has the most uplifting themes. This book can be summed up in this one quote: ""Why not forgive? In a world where you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy.""  I adored all the cameos and callbacks to Abby's previous books. This one can definitely be read as a stand alone, but I think reading her books in the order they were published would make all those easter eggs more delightful. (Think listening to Tortured Poets as the first Taylor Swift album you've ever listened to versus listening to it with the rest of her catalog in mind. Same concept.)  Five brilliant, sparkling stars, and one hilarious rainbow unicorn floatie.

R2QQ3AJ2NN8X3E,Well worth the time spent reading.,"I was skeptical at first, sometimes you read a romance and suddenly you have basically read them all. I loved how this story was so down to earth and real. I touched on the reality of a relationship that has flaws, a relationship that can overcome trauma. There were real life scenarios about the hard parts of a relationship no one wants to talk about. It touched base on childhood trauma, unleashed abandonment issues, true friendship, and how to let go. There were so many good paragraphs, the kind that you take to heart and realize it fits into your own past. The kind that makes you tear up for what feels like no reason and suddenly it hits you. One of my favorites was Emma was talking about her mom with Justin; “You don’t have to forgive her. You really don’t. You can still love someone that you’ve decided not to speak to anymore. You can still wish them well and hope for the best for them. Choosing life without them doesn’t mean you stop caring about them. It just means that you can’t allow them to harm you anymore”. There is another line to this but you will just have to read the book and see. No spoilers from me. I thought this book was planned well for each character and the flow of each one fit perfectly into the proper sequences. Emma and Justine belong together and I love how she referred to him as her docking station. I enjoyed the suspense of two people that really enjoyed each other and the people they called family. I will read another book by this author!","<span>I was skeptical at first, sometimes you read a romance and suddenly you have basically read them all.

I just want to hug emma because she deserves the best and she truly didn’t grow up with that. amber pissed me off so much because of everything she did/does to emma. But I love that despite thinking of herself as on an island alone, emma trusts that she has maddy. Maddy is the best friend we all need!  The romance in this book is 100/10. Justin is absolutely the definition of “If He Wanted To, He Would” because the unicorn floatie?! The dates he plans around really funny surveys?! He is such a great son, brother, and partner to emma. We need more real justins in the world!!!  The twists and turns this story takes are absolutely jaw dropping. I was hooked from the very first page and struggled to put the book down. Abby’s writing is at her absolute best in this book & I love the cameos from her other characters🤭  Above all, I love how real the characters, their emotions, and their journeys felt.

They strike up an online friendship until Justin suggests that they date each other and breakup so they can both go on to find their soulmate thus breaking the curse.

Emma is a child of the foster system because she was abandoned by her mother who is bipolar. Getting close to people is very difficult for her and staying in one place is virtually impossible. Justin has family problems of his own. His father died in an accident within the last year or two and his mother is going away for a while leaving Justin to raise his siblings. Justin starts to fall in love with Emma but he comes with kids and Emma never bargained for that.

RH6FMMA17B0CQ,not your typical beach read,"Although I had some struggles with some of the middle of this book, the second half made up for so much of it! At times I felt like the story dragged on and was a little too repetitive, with SO MANY plot lines (but that could just be a me thing or the space my head was in), and it took me almost 2 weeks to finish it which is not common with a romance, especially an Abby Jimenez book.  I loved Justin, Emma, and Maddy. I related in so many ways to Emma and was honestly so triggered anytime Amber was on the page. Emma’s story is one of neglect which was difficult and heartbreaking to read, especially as you began to see how it affects her into her adult life and her friendships/ relationships.  I adored Justin. The effort her showed, his humor and playfulness, his steadiness and care. He was truly a soft place to land for Emma. The rawness and vulnerability this book had brought me to tears multiple times. I could say so much more but overall, really enjoyed the book!  No spoilers but chapters 40/41 hit me HARD.

RDK3201EPU9HU,Amazing book,"I love Abby Jimenez's books because it's about more than the romance. There's always much deeper themes and the characters are always really fleshed out, and very human with trauma and things that they have been through and need to overcome in order to find the love they deserve. This was no exception, and I just love what the author did with this story. Justin and Emma both have their own stuff, and it's a LOT but at the core of it all is that they both gravitate toward each other because they share the same curse: after each person they date, that person goes on to find the love of their life. So, Justin and Emma decide to ""date"", then break up, in an attempt to break the curse and both go on to find their own soulmates. But what begins as a just an adventure to break their fate leads them down the path they're actually supposed to be on. I loved Justin and his Golden Retriever energy and how sweet he was with everyone. He always let Emma and his siblings know how important they are to him, and never hesitated to step up to the plate. Emma was someone I related to, because that avoidant attachment is so hard to heal from, but Justin was there for her every step of the way. I absolutely LOVED the connection with Briana, Jacob, Alexis, Daniel and others from previous books by Abby Jimenez. It made me SO happy to see everyone again! It was like coming home and seeing your family, and Yours Truly is one of my favorite books EVER so I was ecstatic that it all tied together. I just love this book so much and enjoyed every minute of it.","<span>I love Abby Jimenez's books because it's about more than the romance.

RIUPZAKU6JI9L,A pleasant surprise.,"This book had me in a choke hold. I had seen the book cover floating around my Audible app for some time. I also watched a brief interview of the author on one of the morning talk shows, maybe CBS? I like to leave the tv on for the cat and dog to watch Price is Right when I’m gone for work. Anyway, I listened to a few minutes of the book on Spotify and immediately decided I wanted to read the book. In my impatience, not willing to wait for a hard copy, I downloaded the Kindle app and subsequently, the book. While I was busy running errands and couldn’t sit to read, I listened to the story. I was giggling, gaping and tearing up while driving, chopping herbs for a marinade and paying bills. I finally sat down to read and didn’t stop until midnight. I woke up this morning and immediately began to listen again. I read during any down time I had, and just finished the book moments ago. There are nuggets of wisdom sprinkled throughout this book that can only be thought up and written by someone with a complex, yet kind, heart. This is a heart-breaking story about love, a deep understanding of one’s self, and people’s compassion for one another, especially for one’s chose family. 12/10 recommend.","<span>This book had me in a choke hold.

In my impatience, not willing to wait for a hard copy, I downloaded the Kindle app and subsequently, the book. While I was busy running errands and couldn’t sit to read, I listened to the story. I was giggling, gaping and tearing up while driving, chopping herbs for a marinade and paying bills. I finally sat down to read and didn’t stop until midnight. I woke up this morning and immediately began to listen again. I read during any down time I had, and just finished the book moments ago. There are nuggets of wisdom sprinkled throughout this book that can only be thought up and written by someone with a complex, yet kind, heart. This is a heart-breaking story about love, a deep understanding of one’s self, and people’s compassion for one another, especially for one’s chose family. 12/10 recommend.</span>",5,False,True,us,False,9,3,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2024",2024-04-17T00:00:00.000Z,KyleeWells,,,1538704439,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIUPZAKU6JI9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1538704439,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGR2TGD5AXKXFCQPOKAHBOYAVDPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AGR2TGD5AXKXFCQPOKAHBOYAVDPQ,,,

It also speaks to the long-term impact of unaddressed trauma.  Emotional: I found myself chuckling one moment and reaching for the tissues the next.

Current: Effortlessly taps into the spirit of today without feeling forced.  In closing, I'm off to read another book by Abby Jimenez.","<span>I will preface that this is not my typical genre.

This is another one of those books that will tug at your heartstrings. In the past, it was usually between the two main characters. What's different in this love story is that the heartache is caused by external forces—family. Right person, wrong time and crappy family.  Abby does an excellent job of making both Justin and Emma REALLY LIKABLE because Emma's mom (Amber, yes the same mom from A Part of Your World) is SUPER UNLIKABLE. Having personally dealt with someone whose mom was neglectful, but watching the person I love wait for crumbs of affection hit hard for me. I felt like both Justin and Emma's best friend Maddie...WHY EMMA WHY?! Justin's mom isn't a terrible person. She's just a mom who was drowning in grief who didn't reach out to anyone and is paying the price for her bad behavior. This leaves Justin in a tough position to be the primary guardian for his younger siblings.  I highly recommend this book if you're looking for all the swooning words and gushy feelings with low 🌶. The flirty banter is well-written, Justin is the most EXTRA book-boyfriend, and cameos from other books were fun.","<span>I discovered Abby's work a few months ago and read everything she wrote as soon as possible.

One thing I do admire about Abby Jimenez's writing is the way she incorporates important issues and themes into her stories and makes them flow. This one felt a little too much. The story seemed all over the place at times, with many things happening at once. The romance between Justin and Emma was not as strong for me. Sometimes their relationship felt more like a friendship and other times more romantic. I will say though the dates were pretty cute, the moments between Justin’s siblings and Emma was sweet, and the fact that they supported each other who are dealing with past trauma and experiences.  I liked Justin as the main male character. He is portrayed as strong, caring, devoted to the people he loves, and having a great sense of humor. Emma was an okay main female character. I did enjoy the other characters such as Emma's best friend, Maddy, and Justin's siblings and friends. I was stuck on whether to rate this a 3.5 or 4. I went with a solid four stars.  ☆ 4 stars","<span>I love Abby Jimenez as she is one of my favorite authors.

R1PKCHF09FY748,I’m obsessed. Again.,"Abby Jimenez has quickly become one of my fave authors, especially after “Yours Truly”, and most DEFINITELY after this read. She has a way of writing such raw characters that I can relate to and I feel like I am feeling what they’re feeling so deeply. Her way of incorporating mental health and other human difficulties in her stories is breathtaking. Heartbreaking, yes, but genius. It shines light, doesn’t romanticise or use it as shock value. It’s informative. It tells a story. A story that so many in the world can relate to. Abby, thank you for creating two stories (that I’ve read so far) that have completely and utterly captured my heart. I can’t wait to read more of your work.  Also, long live the toilet king, and I’m sure Brad is not that ugly.  Yours, for longer than the summer, Alex, xoxo","<span>Abby Jimenez has quickly become one of my fave authors, especially after “Yours Truly”, and most DEFINITELY after this read.

R210UW3LXGD3ZD,Good summer prep book 📚,"### **Review: Summer Bridge Activities 5th to 6th Grade Workbooks**  As a parent who’s keen on keeping my child engaged and learning over the summer, I was thrilled to find the *Summer Bridge Activities 5th to 6th Grade Workbooks*. This comprehensive workbook set has been a fantastic tool for preventing the dreaded summer slide and ensuring my child is prepared for the upcoming school year. Here’s why I love it:  #### **Content and Coverage** The workbook covers an impressive range of subjects—Math, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Science, Social Studies, and even Fitness. Each section is thoughtfully designed to reinforce concepts from 5th grade and gradually introduce 6th-grade material. My child has particularly enjoyed the reading comprehension and writing activities, which are engaging and just challenging enough to keep her interested without causing frustration. The inclusion of fitness activities is a fun bonus, promoting physical activity alongside academic work.  #### **Structure and Organization** The workbook is divided into daily activities, which makes it easy to manage and track progress. Each day’s work is laid out clearly, with a mix of subjects to keep things interesting. I love that it doesn’t feel overwhelming; the bite-sized chunks are perfect for summer when kids want to balance learning with fun. The progress tracking stickers have been a hit with my daughter, giving her a sense of accomplishment as she completes each day’s activities.  #### **Educational Value** The educational value of this workbook is outstanding. It does a great job of reinforcing key skills while introducing new concepts in a way that’s accessible and engaging. The math problems are varied and practical, covering everything from basic arithmetic to introductory geometry and fractions. The reading passages are diverse and interesting, promoting critical thinking and comprehension. The science and social studies sections are well-rounded, offering a broad spectrum of topics that are both informative and intriguing.  #### **Flash Cards** The inclusion of flash cards is a fantastic addition. They’ve been great for quick reviews and practice, especially for math facts and vocabulary. My child enjoys the interactive aspect of using the flash cards, and they’ve been a useful tool for reinforcing what she’s learned in the workbook. They’re also convenient for on-the-go learning, making it easy to keep up with studies during car rides or while waiting for appointments.  #### **Ease of Use** One of the best things about this workbook is how user-friendly it is. The instructions are clear, and the layout is intuitive, making it easy for kids to work independently. As a parent, I appreciate the answer key in the back, which makes it simple to check work and provide feedback. The workbook also includes tips and strategies for parents, which have been helpful in guiding my child’s learning.  #### **Pros:** - **Comprehensive Coverage:** Includes a wide range of subjects, ensuring a well-rounded review. - **Daily Structure:** Organized into manageable daily tasks that prevent overwhelm. - **Engaging Content:** Keeps kids interested with diverse activities and topics. - **Flash Cards Included:** Great for quick review and reinforcing key concepts. - **Easy to Use:** Clear instructions and layout promote independent work.  #### **Cons:** - **Paper Quality:** The pages could be a bit thicker to prevent bleed-through with markers. - **Limited Summer Themes:** More summer-themed activities could make it feel more seasonal.  #### **Conclusion** Overall, the *Summer Bridge Activities 5th to 6th Grade Workbooks* are a fantastic resource for any parent looking to keep their child’s brain active and engaged over the summer. The mix of subjects, engaging activities, and clear structure make it a hit in our household. My daughter has enjoyed using it, and I’ve seen a noticeable improvement in her readiness for the next school year. I highly recommend this workbook for any parent wanting to combine learning with fun over the summer.  This workbook has made our summer learning routine enjoyable and effective, and I’m confident it will be a great asset for your child as well!","<span>### **Review: Summer Bridge Activities 5th to 6th Grade Workbooks**<br><br>As a parent who’s keen on keeping my child engaged and learning over the summer, I was thrilled to find the *Summer Bridge Activities 5th to 6th Grade Workbooks*.

R1VUK9AV7W542R,Great Way To Keep The Skills Fresh Over The Summer!,"This is a great activity book to help keep your child stay mentally active when out of school for the summer. Over the years we have purchased a few different Summer Bridge books for our daughter. These books are not meant to be a full school curriculum, but instead a way to keep children mentally active during the summer break. Each summer we do our best to keep skills active and minimize the loss during the extended break. While we sometimes mix in other work to help her to increase skills, we are more worried about the atrophy that happens when not in school. It can be tough returning to school after 3 months without any schoolwork and we try to help her keep topics fresh without filling her summer with full days of 'school' work.  As with other books in this series, this is a solid mix of skills with some being easy and others more of stretch. The difficulty level will likely depend on the schooling your child got during the academic year. I suspect most kids heading into sixth grade will find much of the work in this book at least a strong refresher and potentially give them a nudge in some areas. The exercises are organized to be a roughly 15 minute daily regime but you may decide to enhance it with other work if your child has areas that need more attention (i.e., add in more math or spelling activities). This book is not deficient in an area, we just occasionally add a little extra for topics that we feel could use a bit more work while still keeping the total workload to around 45-60 minutes per day. The Summer Bridge Activities book is a constant though with at least one page used almost every day and the other work rotated.","<span>This is a great activity book to help keep your child stay mentally active when out of school for the summer.

As a woman who is in perimenopause and just starting MHT, I appreciate all of the information about MHT, especially since so many doctors are unaware of the most recent guidelines and are reluctant to prescribe it. I also like that non-pharmacological options are discussed. My biggest complaint is that when other pages of the book are referenced (for example, “See page 145 for a discussion on fiber supplements.”) the page numbers are wrong.

One chapter needs a little more information on it is the recommendation on getting a calcium score test done. Patients need to know that Calcium test or CAC isn't a desirable test because it doesn't show soft plaque. Soft plaque is what causes stenosis of the coronary arteries and is only seen on a CTA. If I have high cholesterol and high LDLs and go and get a CAC, test, and it comes back zero that doesn't mean I am not a risk for coronary artery disease. For example, if I go on Lipitor, a statin drug, and my calcium score is zero and I go back and get a CAC in a couple of months of being on Lipitor, your calcium score of zero will go up! My doctor told me that statin drugs are raising people's CAC scores! When his patients see this they can't understand why this is happening. Statin drugs harden the soft plaque. Soft plaque, the plaque that is more thrombogenic, is hardened from statin drugs and now is calcified plaque. Thus, bringing up your calcium score. I highly recommend a CTA and not a CAC. CTA will show soft plaque and where it is. The location of the soft plaque, too is very important. My own mom had a very high CAC score because she was on Lipitor for years. Research has proven this with a large analysis of the MESA dataset that demonstrated that statins are associated with increasing CAC score.","<span>Dr. Mary Claire has really helped me understand my perimenopause symptoms and helped me to be an advocate for myself.

RSDNZSZQE5F2C,"It gets the job done, but makes summer practice a most boring chore!","I bought K to 1, 1st to 2nd, and 3rd to 4th. These are definitely better than the First Grade Bound (etc) that I bought last year (those ones had no order, no plan, and didn't match grade levels well). I really liked the daily break down of the Summer Bridge books. It was a clear and easy to follow - so easy the kids didn't need me to tell them what to do each day. They matched grade level fairly well. But holy cow these books are BORING! It's just work. Blah. There is no attempt to actually engage the children, just busy work. My husband and I are college graduates and are education-minded. We push our kids to learn for learning's sake, but these books make education as boring as it can get. If you want bland just-do-this-and-get-it-over-with work to keep the brain going, these are more than adequate. I'm looking forward to trying out the Brain Quest Summer books which seem to make it more of a game and the activities are not just long lists of boring-ness.  My other complaint is the inconsistency in the grade levels. The 1st to 2nd grade was the best one - well balanced and challenging enough to keep the brain going, but easy enough for light summer work. It had a particularly good ratio of math, language, reading, writing, and social studies and pretty much all of the activities were manageable with the right amount of challenge.  The K to 1 book was mostly ok. The first of the three sections was so ridiculously easy that my daughter did it all on her own before school was even over (she wanted to!). It was activities like circling the right number of apples or just writing a single letter a bunch of times. She finished what was supposed to be a month's worth of work in about a week in her spare time. Fortunately we didn't need all three sections since their summer is only 9 weeks, so the other two sections got us through the rest of the summer doing a two-sided page ""day"" 5 days a week.  The 3rd to 4th grade book had the opposite problem. It started off great, but halfway through the second section much of the math was getting overly busy and sometimes too complex. There were many division problems that are beyond what he had learned in 3rd grade, and he's in G.A.T.E. In class they only covered multiplication and division 0-12. Example: 496 / 4 = ___. Example: A word problem where he has to work out either 162 / 18 or 18 x __ = 162. He got the concepts as I taught them, but it was frustrating. Some activities were just too lengthy for a quick summer book, such as a set of 10 addition problems like this: 8214 + 7716 + 6389 = ____. It's not that it was hard, but does he really need to do 10 of those, on top of three other activities? One of which is MORE math? There were many times his brother and sister would be done with their books plus 20 minutes of reading and in the pool while he was still working. Granted he likes to stall, so I always had him finish it to avoid rewarding his stalling, but I have to admit that I thought it was too much busy work. That and I found myself teaching him stuff he'd never seen before.  Bottom line is that these books were inconsistent and tedious and I will try others before I buy them again.","<span>I bought K to 1, 1st to 2nd, and 3rd to 4th.

RTV7428Z34JES,Good at identifying learning gaps,"This was a good workbook for my post-1st grader. She had in person school for most of the year, but for limited days at first, and after 15 months of disrupted school followed by a household move to a more challenging school, I wanted to make sure she was a little more prepared academically.  Immediately we were able to see where the gaps in her learning vs. the expected 1st grade curriculum were, and the book gave us a tool to start filling those in bit by bit over the summer. I think she still has a challenging year ahead of us, but this workbook helped her from sliding backwards, taught her some new things, and in general let us feel much better about the nearly 4 month summer break that resulted from moving to an area on a different school calendar.  The work was definitely challenging for her, but manageable. It was probably 10-15 minutes of work per day if she focused and did it.

I think she still has a challenging year ahead of us, but this workbook helped her from sliding backwards, taught her some new things, and in general let us feel much better about the nearly 4 month summer break that resulted from moving to an area on a different school calendar.<br><br>The work was definitely challenging for her, but manageable.

R3DR3BUF0T332B,Great resource for kids to keep up on skills for the next year,"I have been using these the last few years with my kids and have been super impressed. I have used the preschool to kindergarten, 1st to 2nd grade, and 2nd grade to 3rd. My favorite thing about these work books are that they can be fast and simple lessons that usually take about 15 minutes or less to do. The other thing I like is they aren’t just math or reading. Each day they mix in several different concepts. I feel that way the kids don’t get overwhelmed with a subject or concept they might struggle with. It also GRADUALLY gets a little more difficult each day. So by the time summer is over they are being introduced to things that they will learn for the next year. They also come with flash cards that are made of good card stock to work on concepts like: letters, shapes, numbers, telling time, multiplication, divide, and other concepts that are age appropriate. There are small stickers at the back that the kids can put on their page after they are done that are just small stars. There is also a parent key at the back to check if the kid’s work is correct. I’m not going to lie I have used! :) Overall these have been great. The hardest thing I have struggled with is just being consistent and making sure they try and do them each day.

R7MI8KP0YOUOS,Couldn't live up to the Fourth Wing Hype,"I had such incredibly high hopes for Iron Flame after Fourth Wing that I stayed up and read all in one night (finished at 5 am!), but while Iron Flame is a good book, it doesn't live up to Fourth Wing. I was able to get an early copy of the book and it still took me 4 days to finish.  So what's done well? The story itself is incredible. There are many intricacies both with the humans, dragons, and other species we are introduced to. Rebecca Yarros knows how to throw in a few really good twists. Violet is a relatable main character who doesn't always believe in herself, but still rises to any challenge. Character development for Violet's mother delves us deeper into who she is as a person and why she does the things she does. Dain has finally redeemed himself mostly.  What's done poorly? Character development for some of the main characters felt either nonexistent (Hi Sawyer, forgot you were here) or is such a drastic change (Xaden is now lovesick and while I felt like it was meant to be a strong, I'll burn this world down for you, I was starting to get Tamlin vibes instead. I felt like he got kind of whiney). Then there's the whole issue of the book feeling like it revolved entirely around Violet and Xaden's relationship (the first 3/4 of the book is Violet just lusting after Xaden while the other 1/4 is them fighting) and everything else (including the Venin, Wyverns, displacement of people and cadets, dragon issues) were all completely secondary. What I had loved about the first book was that it felt the opposite - where Xaden and Violet had a budding romance, but it was a fantasy first novel. This felt like fantasy became the subplot in a way with how much of the focus was on their relationship specifically.  Overall, I'd give it 3.5 stars. It was a good book. Will I reread it? No.","<span>I had such incredibly high hopes for Iron Flame after Fourth Wing that I stayed up and read all in one night (finished at 5 am!), but while Iron Flame is a good book, it doesn't live up to Fourth Wing.

RJONZIJEEMYFL,"Highly, highly recommended!!!","I am so in awe of both ""Fourth Wing"" and ""Iron Flame"" that I thought I would sit here staring at a blank screen for a long time while trying to find words to express my respect for Rebecca Yarros, author of both books. I just spent 3 days reading them and the only reason it took so long is that one still has to bath, eat, water plants, feed pets and sleep though I did not do much of the latter.  What writers call voice in both books is so very perfect that I immediately want to reread both books! The voice is fresh and up-to-date and modern even for the dragons yet fits perfectly into whatever period of time this fantasy took place but clearly when there were dragons! Before proceeding, however, I need to hyperventilate briefly.  First of all, it is totally immature and so unnecessary for anyone to post a critical plot point in a review especially on purpose and without first posting a spoiler alert. This happens not only with these books but others as well. Doing so is just another, although minor, example of how Homo sapiens have free will which they unfortunately can and often do waste on trivialities. So, then, here is how I deal with the review situation.  I do not read them until after I read the book, then I read them to see how others felt about the book. Since one needs to know what the book is about before purchase, then reading the descriptive paragraphs at the listing along with reading the free chapters Amazon thankfully offers at the listing itself will provide that. Thanks Amazon. Reading those chapters and the description plus checking the star/purchase numbers are good steps to take to avoid learning too much in a review prior to reading the book.  The second rant has to do with plot. Let me assure everyone there are NO NEW PLOTS. People have been murdering people since the beginning of time. It is how the author takes a plot(s) and makes it her/his own that matters to the reader. It is doubtful anyone knows how many dragon/people/rider fantasy books are out there so in the end it is a personal opinion as to which book(s) one chooses to like.  Having so many to choose from means some plot points will seem similar. For instance how many ways are there to shove a dagger into someone's ribs, a plot point in a massive number of books? This author knew how to handle the plot she chose and then developed with aplomb. Both books kept my attention fully--page after page after page.  I so love both books. What is so outstanding about both is that we learn most everything we need to know about each well developed character, not by telling, but by showing through their actions and their sharp and sometimes witty dialogue. It is beyond skillful at how on point the conversations are not only between the humans but the humans and their dragons especially Tairn and Violet and with Andarna--such a cutie and definitely my favorite dragon. The growing relationship between Violet and Xaden is razor sharp and on point.  Violet gets wonky with her ""having to know all the truth up front demands"" regardless of how Xaden has put forth so much effort to show her he cares. Everyone has secrets but a book needs tension to advance so whoa and hold on the tension builds and builds between those two. Xaden is my favorite character out of many favorites. Their arguments are worth ""eavesdropping"" on and their love scenes are well done (Chapter 48 is mentioned by some reviewers).  In this book Violet, in spite of her fragile bones and smaller size but because of her iron will and cleverness, and all those who made it through First Year at the Basgiath War College (covered in Fourth Wing"") are now Second Years. Third years like my favorite character, Xaden, have graduated out and been assigned to outposts outside Basgiath. Thus begins an every other week trip for Violet and Xaden, him with her one weekend, her with him the next weekend. This is so their mated dragons can have time together each weekend.  It is also in this book that Basgiath and all the outposts are put in perspective regarding the coming battle. The 'revolution' becomes a much larger focal point and Violet learns about Xaden's connection to the estate in Aretia. One can already see by this point how hard it is to give this book the 10 star, 100% review it deserves! Just read it and see what I mean. It is one well-done, well written heck of a book and do not forget ""Fourth Wing first!!  This book covers in more detail wards, the reason for them and the ins and outs of setting them up and what happens when they do not work (descriptive details I liked BTW). Details regarding the approaching battle then the battle itself are incredible. I am skimming plot points here since others have covered them very well but there is a lot of stuff left hanging at the end of this book and the end itself will floor you. It is like learning to fly on your own and suddenly losing that ability and plopping onto the ground and then fighting to just take a breath. It is shocking, promise.  When an author has done their job, the reader will fantasize about what may happen next but this book leaves so much stuff hanging that there has to be another book. My favorite character deserves a better ending--the last two chapters still has me plopped on the ground breathless. So here's a partial list of the left-hanging questions.  What happens between Violet and Xaden after the battle's aftermath? What happens to Aretia? Will Andarna's newly acquired fire play a role in the future especially in helping to set up wards? What happens to Basgiath after the war? What happens about the new dragon hatchlings? Will Cat's crew of riders play a future role? And, BTW, how did Jack get the way he turned out?  So very many unanswered questions in addition to many, many not covered here.

R3CZYOY2EUJJJS,This book broke me in the best way 🫠🥲,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💫 - 4.5 stars ****tried to be vague as possible but may be slight spoilers read at your own risk*** What I loved: - Xaden & Violet - Their love confessions - Fighting for one another - All the twists, unexpected plot bombs everywhere - The dragons complete this story, Tairn & Andarna forever 💕 - Iron squad - Found family gets even stronger - Sorrengail siblings - All the action and battles were epic - Felix is a WAYYYY better teacher than Carr - More backstory, more character development history insight  Didn’t enjoy/wanted more: - more healthy relationship building with Xaden & Violet, less sex and more healthy dicussion so the sex was more meaningful instead of avoiding meaningful discussion - More trust for Xaden from Violet (we started getting there) - Violet to not lose her confidence in her intelligence - The freaking ending. Are you kidding me?! The battle was hard enough. Did Rebecca really have to do that???! “You should be scared of me” - More Iron Squad shenanigans, never enough - More of Xaden’s history - More from Violet’s childhood, specifically need more details on dad - LESS OF JFB 😡 - More about Tairn & Sgaeyl’s relationship - Everything about Cat pissed me off, it sorta resolved but also felt a little unnecessary, but I saw why she’s in the story to push Xaden towards more honesty. But still hated just about everything about her character -  I didn’t know I was capable of being so invested in a couple’s story. But here I am praying Xaden & Violet get their HEA somewhere in this long series 🫠 I don’t have all the words for my feelings about this book.

R1ZU5DRCKWEBOE,So much more to dragons than their wings!,"Woth more than 5 stars! The worst part of this book is the knowledge that the next one won't be out until late next year. The 2nd most irksome thing is that yes, there are content warnings, but you have to leave the book to read them. Seriously? Without being gratuitous, there is some sex, violence, profanity, and poor decisions. There are other things that triggered me but were essential to the plot.  The book picks up right as The Fourth Wing ends. There are so many secrets between the characters. The way Violet and Xaden deal with secrets sometimes makes me want to grind my teeth. They finally start coming to some adult relationship decisions that I hope they can keep in the next book.  While the humans, all of the humans, deal with their training, battles, relationships, and secrets, the dragons come forward more. Their relationships to their chosen deepen, their own skills are put more on display, and how each is a unique individual not just stereotyped by color, rider, or den. We learn more about the politics of the Empyrean and that the politics of the dragons is not necessarily in line with or shared with the humans.  I hope the next book brings Andarna into play more often. She was where she needed to be, but at one point, when Violet tells Tairn she misses Andarna, I realized I did too. Like Violet, she is so much more than she seems, and I really appreciated her adolescent viewpoint to compare to Tairn's.  There are new relationships forged as we get to meet more gryphons and their fliers. While practical, walking out the idea that the enemy of my enemy is my friend can be challenging. Thankfully, Tairn reminds us, ""We do not eat our allies."" I really enjoyed the time spent as they get to know each other and learn to appreciate their similarities and differences, and finally come to respect.  The training and battle scenes were amazing! I tend to both listen and read a book I really like, especially when I know I won't have time to sit and read. I found for some of the action scenes I needed to go back and read them. For me, it helps me picture it in my head better. That isn't a critique of the writing or narration, just how my brain processed things. I enjoyed both!  This series is an excellent read for those who love Anne McCaffery's Pern, anyone who likes a little military structure in they fantasy, and anyone who enjoys fantasy and knows pain from the moment the wake up. May our boxes hold as well as Violet's.","<span>Woth more than 5 stars! The worst part of this book is the knowledge that the next one won't be out until late next year. The 2nd most irksome thing is that yes, there are content warnings, but you have to leave the book to read them. Seriously? Without being gratuitous, there is some sex, violence, profanity, and poor decisions. There are other things that triggered me but were essential to the plot.<br><br>The book picks up right as The Fourth Wing ends. There are so many secrets between the characters. The way Violet and Xaden deal with secrets sometimes makes me want to grind my teeth. They finally start coming to some adult relationship decisions that I hope they can keep in the next book.<br><br>While the humans, all of the humans, deal with their training, battles, relationships, and secrets, the dragons come forward more. Their relationships to their chosen deepen, their own skills are put more on display, and how each is a unique individual not just stereotyped by color, rider, or den. We learn more about the politics of the Empyrean and that the politics of the dragons is not necessarily in line with or shared with the humans.<br><br>I hope the next book brings Andarna into play more often. She was where she needed to be, but at one point, when Violet tells Tairn she misses Andarna, I realized I did too. Like Violet, she is so much more than she seems, and I really appreciated her adolescent viewpoint to compare to Tairn's.<br><br>There are new relationships forged as we get to meet more gryphons and their fliers. While practical, walking out the idea that the enemy of my enemy is my friend can be challenging. Thankfully, Tairn reminds us, ""We do not eat our allies."" I really enjoyed the time spent as they get to know each other and learn to appreciate their similarities and differences, and finally come to respect.<br><br>The training and battle scenes were amazing! I tend to both listen and read a book I really like, especially when I know I won't have time to sit and read. I found for some of the action scenes I needed to go back and read them. For me, it helps me picture it in my head better. That isn't a critique of the writing or narration, just how my brain processed things. I enjoyed both!<br><br>This series is an excellent read for those who love Anne McCaffery's Pern, anyone who likes a little military structure in they fantasy, and anyone who enjoys fantasy and knows pain from the moment the wake up.

There is no unseeing something that will tarnish your own feelings. Just look at the stars and how many ratings have been left. Once you have completed the series read and enjoy the reviews.

That’s all you need to know.  Yarros has an amazing ability to construct an intricately woven story with twists and payoffs. I appreciated this second book's immediate focus on those qualities after the first book's ending.  Spoiler Alert: This addresses the first book's final chapters. I realize her genre is ""Romantasy Fiction"" but she could have been more consistent with a less-is-more approach to angst and sex. Sometimes she unnecessarily went on paragraph after paragraph page after page. Even having done it once, all it would take is a hint to get the point across each time thereafter yet she would drop back into every detail and even implausibly while in the midst of battle. Come on! No one would think in such detail and about relationship angst during a battle for your life. That indulgence only comprises 2% of the book and takes place towards the end yet it delved too long and too repetitively to go unmentioned. I am certain some and many readers enjoyed every word of it. This is Romantasy. On the other hand this story would be great even if the ""romance"" was not so graphic that it was ""Fantasy Fiction"" instead of ""Romantasy Fiction.""

I felt every emotion under the sun, laughing one moment then being pissed off the next. There were hardly any moments where I felt I could take a mental rest because of how action-centered this book was. I’m still in awe that this is only book 2 out of a 5 book series given all that happened.  It’s no secret that I absolutely adore the main characters & their dragons, but what took me by surprise was my fixation for the supporting characters. I’m usually indifferent when it comes to side characters, but Yarros made it utterly impossible for me NOT to care. I thought Liam was the exception but after finishing Iron Flame, I realized I’m completely attached to the entire squad—new members included.  This book just about alleviated most of the queries I harbored from Fourth Wing, while also sparking up so many more. My advice before going into this book is to re-read Fourth Wing right before jumping into Iron Flame. I personally followed this route, and it was definitely worth taking the extra time. Most of the theories I pondered in the first book were set to rest and I’m glad for it.  With all that being said, I can admit that this was by no means a perfect book. There were things I found unnecessary and some scenes I thought were anticlimactic. However, for being only the second book of a series, I think Yarros did a fantastic job— hence, there’s still plenty of time to iron out the bumps in the story.

R6337G1AJS2WA,second year brings Violet more torture,"We're picking up right where the other book left off-- a good friend is dead, Violet and the rest of her squad are still together about to enter Second Year at Basgiath war college, and Xaden is being sent to the front lines as a graduated Lieutenant.  Added to the mix is a new war college vice commander who has it in for Violet, mysterious healer goings-on, and the oncoming war with Wyverns and Venin ramping up.  Plus the dead friend's little sister who blames Violet for the friend's death entering as a first year.  There's alot of fluffing around with Violet making a big deal about not trusting Xaden, a big reveal of a baddie we thought gone, backstory about how wardstones are made, and a lot of steamy times between Xaden and Violet that read more like an adult paranormal than YA, and alot of pompous announcements from Tairn whilst Violet gets caught up in severe danger and he's always 5 minutes away from saving her.  Gotta hand it to Yarros, there's alot of action scenes here, especially in the last third of the book, that made my heart race a bit because this author has already proved she'll put characters through major damage.  There was a second year secret trial that-- yikes-- made me blanch. There's severe damage, and then there's SEVERE damage. When Violet has a conversation with the Grphyon riders about how failing to bond with a Gryphon doesn't end in death and she's like ""huh, imagine that"" I wanted to smack her and Yarros over the head.  This is major character abuse. Yikes.  But we must all like it because we keep reading.

R3VI7F1ASOZ6FL,Intense Second Installment,"I am going to do my best to make this a non-spoiler review. There is just so much in this book that I can’t talk about due to it spoiling one thing or another, especially that ending. I mean, where did that come from, how do we move on from here. I am not okay.  This is the second book in The Empyrean Series. This book picks up right where the first one ends. I just need to say I get that it’s a war college, but oh my god what these people endure. I want to note that there is torture in the book, however it is actually handled well, you will cringe but its not overly graphic. There was so much action going on in this one that I had a hard time putting it down. I can only imagine how the next book is going to go.  Of course after the ending of Fourth Wing there are a lot of issues between Violet and Xaden and even though they are stubborn and well young there is a lot of talk about why communication is so important for their relationship to work. Communication is discussed a lot in the book, so I am wondering if it’s a set-up for what is to come or the author really wanted to push it home. I mean, even Tarin and Sgaeyl have a moment and OMG the secret Andarna has. I am not well.  Vi is pissed for a good bit of the book, mostly justified, but they pull though when she thinks Xaden is possibly on his deathbed. And there the romance picks up. Oh, and assassins are being sent to kill anyone that survived the ending of book one so that they can’t tell the truth about what’s out there. And then the whole let’s bring back person X. I am still confused about a few things. Let’s just say the stakes start high in this book and just keep climbing.  The family that Vi created in book one just gets stronger and every time Rhi, Ridoc, and Sawyer were in trouble I had so much anxiety because we just can’t lose them. I know that thinking like that means that someone isn’t going to make it, but I am way too attached. And I will root for them all to make it to the end every time. The problem is now that alliances have been forged this found family has grown and now all these characters need to stay safe too.  Tarin may still be one of my absolute favorite characters in these books. I love this dialog and the fact that every time Vi doubts herself, he reminds her that he picked her because of XYZ. He may be one of the absolute toughest dragons, but he has a big heart. Sgaeyl didn’t seem to be as present in this book, and I think that was because she was off the page a lot. I hope it doesn’t mean anything. Then we have our precious Andarna who might just be hiding the biggest secret of them all. She is still a witty young dragon who apparently knows her worth, even if she isn’t telling anyone, including Tarin. Poor Tarin everyone was keeping secrets from him.

It follows the classic framework for protagonist, antagonist, and love triangle you could see. The boundaries for the battle between good vs evil are gray as there are three sides fighting for good, or are there four? You must choose a side.  The magic the riders use and the energy that flows from the words embed your reading, like a distraction rune is woven into the pages.

R2IKGIQ23BPQAP,That Ending Though!!,"I put off reading this book because I knew that there was no set date on when book 3 would be out and I wanted to prolong this experience as long as possible. It was worth it but not because I found out some of the twists before reading them. This book and series have been epic to me. It's like a mix of Harry Potter, with ACOTAR feels and dragons and ruthlessness. There were a few things that I wish there were more of BUT I will address in a sec.  This book picks up right where we left off from book 1. Violet is back at Basgiath and is supposed to act like nothing that happened as happened. Oh and Xaden is graduating. They aren't together even though he clearly wants to be and with him graduating they will only get to see each other every week MAYBE. The crew that shows up after they disappeared will all be almost interrogated to see if they will crack on where they actually were. The biggest struggle I had with this book was the lack of time with Xaden and Violet and then with that ""time"" that they got Violet used it terribly. They would either be arguing or she would ignore him even though she clearly missed him. The lack of spice in this one was disappointing as well. Violet was just a BIT too whiny for me :/ She was a little all over the place.  Anywho back to the plot- Violet's friends are starting to put together that she isn't telling them something. Violet is on the hunt to find out more history from the original 6. She is looking into wards. Things happen. She makes decisions that end up with majority of the college now in Aretia where a temporary college is setup for the ""rebels"" if you will. Everyone knows there is an epic showdown on the horizon with the venin, but they don't know how to stop them. Will everyone make it? Will they learn how to do the wards? Do we learn more about the venin and their history?  AHHHH the ending of this book was just epic!! I am so scared and excited to see where this goes. I don't think I have read a book yet where this happens and can't wait to see what Rebecca has in store for us. I loved how she throws in tidbits of history at the beginning of each chapter that come into fruition later in the book. I should probably pay more attention to those because they indicate where things are headed LOL. I would ask one small thing for book 3- pretty please don't make us wait forever??","<span>I put off reading this book because I knew that there was no set date on when book 3 would be out and I wanted to prolong this experience as long as possible. It was worth it but not because I found out some of the twists before reading them. This book and series have been epic to me. It's like a mix of Harry Potter, with ACOTAR feels and dragons and ruthlessness. There were a few things that I wish there were more of BUT I will address in a sec.<br><br>This book picks up right where we left off from book 1. Violet is back at Basgiath and is supposed to act like nothing that happened as happened. Oh and Xaden is graduating. They aren't together even though he clearly wants to be and with him graduating they will only get to see each other every week MAYBE. The crew that shows up after they disappeared will all be almost interrogated to see if they will crack on where they actually were. The biggest struggle I had with this book was the lack of time with Xaden and Violet and then with that ""time"" that they got Violet used it terribly. They would either be arguing or she would ignore him even though she clearly missed him. The lack of spice in this one was disappointing as well. Violet was just a BIT too whiny for me :/ She was a little all over the place.<br><br>Anywho back to the plot- Violet's friends are starting to put together that she isn't telling them something. Violet is on the hunt to find out more history from the original 6. She is looking into wards. Things happen. She makes decisions that end up with majority of the college now in Aretia where a temporary college is setup for the ""rebels"" if you will. Everyone knows there is an epic showdown on the horizon with the venin, but they don't know how to stop them. Will everyone make it? Will they learn how to do the wards? Do we learn more about the venin and their history?<br><br>AHHHH the ending of this book was just epic!! I am so scared and excited to see where this goes.

The characters are well developed, and the story is well told. As I was reading the books, I was thinking what great books they would be for a young reader until I got to the chapters about the romantic interests of two of the characters. The chapters read like a cross between a Harlequin romance and Penthouse Forum. These chapters made the books inappropriate for anyone under 18, and as an adult, I thought it was too much, and thumbed through it until it was over (if it was a movie I would have fast forwarded). It was only disappointing because the writing was so good, I’m sure the author could have told the story without being so graphic, really limiting the audience for this book. Other than that, well done and I’m looking forward to the next book.","<span>Both Iron Flame and Fourth Wing are fantastic stories that draw you in to where you can’t put the book down.

R3C9YPVVY33SHM,The Pain. The Laughs. The Tears.,"How am I supposed to live, laugh, love in these conditions?  I have so many thoughts that my mind is SPINNING. My brain literally hurts. Last 100 or so pages? Chill bumps. This book had, and still has, me in a chokehold. It was tense, mysterious, stressful, HOT, and so much fun (at first at least).  Was it long? Absolutely. Was I scared to start it? Yes. Mainly because I’d seen so many mixed reviews! I was worried it wouldn’t live up to the hype. Safe to say, I was wrong. It was perfection and then some.  I enjoyed the first part’s world building, banter, and “filler” (some may call it). I had fun reading it and it kept me flipping page after page. Getting to see more of Violet’s squad was ideal IMO. My appreciation for Rhiannon, Ridoc, Sawyer, etc all grew. The ‘found family’ trope was evident in this book. I also found it necessary for the later parts of the book. I understood more of what each member brought to the table and how important they were to each other.  I was worried we wouldn’t get much Violet/Xaden time since they were separated, but I was mistaken. Their reunions each week were exciting and left me anticipating the next. Across the whole book, watching their relationship grow was awesome. I think the whole “separation makes the heart grow fonder” thing was apparent…and lead to great smut too.  I think one of my favorite aspects was Xaden and his outward affection for Violet. Whether it just be small touches here, or whispered reminders, it was the best. Up front, he’s this tough, moody guy that seems like he’d be annoying as hell. But, as you realize what his weakness is and who is soft spot is for, you can’t help but love him safe to say, he’s one of my top MMCs.  I can’t not talk about the dragons of course. The sass on all fronts was top tier. I have no qualms. I loved Tairn even more than before, and moody Andarna can’t be topped. As the books progress, I am VERY interested to see what happens relating to the dragons.  The build up to the end of the book had me on the edge of my seat. As a reader, knowing a plot is going to span multiple books, you know something is gonna happen. Something frustrating, mind blowing, sad - it’s gonna happen. And it did. The ending left me angry, in fact, I hate it here 🚩  But heck if I’m not ready to devour the next book.  It’s hard to say much without spoiling it, but wow. “WOW” (read in Owen Wilson’s voice)  I hate that I put reading it off for so long, but I’m mad that I didn’t put it off for longer.

R7LJRE11FCLLT,Great sequel!,"11/13 FULL REVIEW: I don't even know where to begin. That ending has left me reeling. And I thought I knew what was coming because some *lovely* person on Goodreads thought to retaliate against the author by dropping a major spoiler with no warning to people like me, who were aimlessly scrolling, so for me to still be shocked and surprised is saying something. And just word to the wise: Be careful out there, folks! There are spoilers everywhere. 😒  Anywhoo...that's my rant. Now back to my review!  Look, there's no surprise Fourth Wing and Rebecca Yarros has taking the book world by storm these past few months and I am LOVING it, okay? This love/ obsession/ hype is giving me all the nostaglia and throwing me back to my Harry Potter days twenty-six (🤯‼️) years ago. With me trying to get my hands on the physical books, the fandom going crazy over the series, the midnight release parties, and all the conversations spurred between readers and friends, it has been amazing to watch and to be apart of, and I am in love with the Fourth Wing Era we are in right now.  There was something ✨️magical✨️ about my reading experience with Fourth Wing earlier this year. It was a combination of right book at the right time and it had me hooked. I was excited to get my hands on the sequel, but went into the book nervous it wouldn't hold a candle to the first one and I would be left disappointed because of my high expectations.  Sadly, this book didn't give me that all consuming, unputdownable feeling I had with FW for the first 25% of the book and that is where my 4 star rating comes into play. I was easily able to read it, because I just think Yarros has this easy, flowing type of writing that even though not alot might be happening on the pages, I am still able to continue on without many delays in my reading time and I was reading this section of the book like I do a normal book. It just wasn't making me abandon all of my responsibilities and make it a top priority to read like FW did, if that makes sense. I think we could have shortened the first 200 pages to make the pacing of the book better overall.  However, let me tell you! Once you get about a fourth of the way through, we get that spark and the twists start dropping and then I became hooked til the final page. And whew, that ending! I was on an emotional rollercoaster for the last 50 pages or so. I'm so paranoid about spoilers with this series, especially after my horrible experience,so I don't even want to say anything else about how I feel or what I am expecting from this series as we continue on this journey for fear of spoiling anything. Let's just say there are lots of theories and it has been fun being able to safely navigate through Instagram, Goodreads, and TikTok without fear of the book being ruined now, and I'd recommend if you want to read book 2, you better do it asap before something gets spoiled for you!  P.S. Still loving the dragons. They are seriously one of the best parts of these books and world. I love their sass, their snark, and just overall, what they bring to the table. 🐉  I love Ridoc's sarcasm and it helped bring levity to the book in general. I really enjoy the side characters in this series and you get really attached to everyone making it enjoyable, but also nerve-racking. 😅  I can't wait for news of book three's release and I've seen articles stating she would let us know 2 weeks after Iron Flames release date, so one more week hopefully and we will know how long we will have to wait for it. Here's hoping it'll only be another 6 months or so and we can have book 3 in our hands by spring. 🤞 I know I'll be pre-ordering multiples this time around and not from just one site, because I don't want the stress of what I went through waiting on Iron Flame to arrive on my doorstep. 🤣  ******************  11/12 : 🤯🤯🤯 I need some time to gather my thoughts.

R1Y4PUSZY2J3JX,"Despite my review, I still recommend this.","The mind wrestling I've been doing internally since finishing the book last night as been UNREAL. What star do I give this? Has this exceeded or fell short of my expectation? Am I being swayed by opinions I've seen on this book? Was it really that bad or am I trying to convince myself it was good. These are all of the questions I've been asking myself leading in to this morning. This book has rattled me so much and right now I am so conflicted.  I fought trying to love this book as much as I had hoped I would. And here I am, even now, trying to convince myself. There are parts, so few parts where I was completely immersed and felt the similarity and connection to the Fourth Wing, so let me explain...  Violet; Who is she in this book?? I'm not sure when or if I missed something but I felt the author genuinely failed out FMC. The entire book, we get this insecure, can't make any right decisions...absolutely no character development. I hardly felt like Violet was a second year (Compared to the first book where the older kids seemed ""way cool and badass and I couldn't wait for our character to be like that) instead we got this horny and whiny thing. I did like how the author interpreted the responsibility that Violet had to take on like needing to keep secrets and what really happened at War Games to herself in order to protect those around her. It was well written how it took its toll on her and her friendships. Of the badassery in the torture chamber and summoning Liam (theory) to be her guardian angel. Then the entire book, she still cannot hit a target with her lightning. Like, give me a break.  The romance also fell short. Some moments were tender and alluring, but not enough in this developing relationship. In Fourth Wing there was more tension and I'm sure I can speak for everyone....we all FELT it thought the text. The throne scene was amazing, but again ended on a bad note. Instead we got this Jealous X trope creating negative tension and unnecessary drama for our characters. The time spent on that could have been spent on writing other more important things. And speaking of drama, the trust dance we had to endure throughout the book was irritating. The hiding things and keeping secrets from each other only because the other didn't simply ask? Ugh. The author then explains how Xaden is trying to earn back Violet's trust...by doing what exactly? Making violet give him the ""three little words"". Stop. There is absolutely no detail or explanation when and how Xaden actually WORKS to earn her trust back...oh by simply telling her that there's been an attack on Samara so she didn't have to hear it in Battle Brief? Please. Oh and the letters...we could have been included in those a little more. Maybe I would have stayed in love with him. Again, very one dimensional and a complete downgrade. Just like any other relationship...like ""Ope, we are together now. I don't need to try anymore.""  This book should have been the next step up. The upgrade. Fourth Wing should have been inferior to this...but I feel it to be completely opposite. The writing....don't even get me started on the writing. So CHOPPY. And rushed. I cannot stand when authors fast forward days, weeks and months and Rebecca did that numerous times throughout. Those could have been precious moments where she could have colorfully grown our characters. But, everything was so...shallow. Lazy. Hardly any world building, and again no character development. Then the information dump that seemed to continuously make my head spin. But then lack of information, especially for our Gryphon squads. We barely even know what's the story about them. Except that Cat is Xadens bitchy X. Yeah, because that's what we want to read about.  But he most disappointing part....the dragons. I really wished for MORE. There should have been so much more as the characters develop a deeper bond with them. Tairn used to be this grumpy dad-like character, full of sarcasm and wisdom. In Iron Flame, he was so....boring. And Andarna, my favorite. Rebecca let me down so much with that done. She slept more than half of the book and was written so dully. All I got was this arrogant and annoying ""adolescent"" character who lacked depth and absolutely no connection to Violet what so ever. But then swoops in and saves the day at the end of the book...  To conclude, the only reason I even finished it was because my attachment to the first book. Hope. Iron Flame was entirely too long, and I wondered why it took me a week to finish it. It was a drag and painful. Overall I am disappointed and this did not meet my expectations. I really hope for Rebecca to turn this around when she plans to continue writing this story. I will give her that the cliffhanger was insane and shocking. But again, no depth. I think this could be really amazing, but the writing needs A LOT of work. If you've made it this far and wondering if I'd recommend it? Yes, of course.

R2P9ATRQYZ44L,Warning: Some Spoilers,"I feel like FBAA, Zodiac Academy and ACOTAR have me prepared to expect all kinds of twists and turns which I think helped soften some of them.  Overall, I loved Iron Flame. It reminded me of the second From Blood and Ash book - there was a lot of world-building and major conflict set up. However, (and trust me I'm usually advocating for less books) I think the first and second half could have been different books. I felt like Varrish (aka Umbridge 2.0) went away way to fast for the kind of villain he was. I was always waiting for him to pop off and he had me on edge. I think we could have been given more Basgiath second-year moments beforehand - like the Interrogation scene should have happened closer to the end of the second year (not the exact day it was supposed to but closer).  The interrogation scene gutted me though - Liam - I sobbed. I was not prepared.  As always, Tarin is my favorite character, but Andarna grows on me more and more. The ended was a semi-throw out of left field, but I'm not mad about it. However, after having read two books where the H and h were separated for the entire book...it feels like that might be how book 3 is, but I hope I'm wrong.","<span>I feel like FBAA, Zodiac Academy and ACOTAR have me prepared to expect all kinds of twists and turns which I think helped soften some of them.<br><br>Overall, I loved Iron Flame.

R3AVOW7C0QOVL5,Very Enjoyable,"Fourth wing was my favorite read last year, and thus my expectations were sky high. Even though I did not think Iron Flame truly lived up to those expectations it was still a very enjoyable book and worth every penny. I found Iron Flame to be a bit messy at times, and that the structure of the story, that I personally felt had been very present in Fourth Wing, was not really there. I also felt that one specific storyline was not necessary at all - the storyline regarding Xaden`s ex, Kat. I don`t usually have a big issue with exes getting introduced to the story, but when they behave the way Kat did I find that i very much do have an issue. While I think that she redeemed herself towards the end of the book I still found the conflict between her and Violet to be very unecessary. However, this was more or less my only gripe with the story. I adored the sibling relationship between Brennan, Mira and Violet, and the friendship between Rhiannon and Violet as well. The underlying plot of this series is something i wholeheartedly enjoy, I find the dragon politics to be very interesting, and as I learn about the venin and the history of this world, I yearn to learn even more. The author has a way of writing that completely pulls you into the story, and even though reading Iron Flame took me longer than reading the first one (3 days), I truly enjoyed every moment. As I said, Fourth Wing was my favorite read from last year and it completely consumed me during the 24 hours i spent reading it. Considering this, I think my expectations would have been too high no matter what Iron Flame was like. It also does help how utterly gorgeous the book is;).The twist towards the end left me reeling and I truly cannot wait for the next book in this series.","<span>Fourth wing was my favorite read last year, and thus my expectations were sky high.

Now that the 3rd book has been announced, I may have to read again, a few more times. I loved this addition to the series. Again, the author went above and beyond when creating this wonderfully written book that flowed so well. I did not want to put the book down. I continue to think that Violet is seriously a bad ass lead character and she really seems to be coming into her own and owning the fact that she can do anything and everything all on her own if she chose to do so. This complex story finds V and Xaden putting their lives on the line for what they believe in, and who can fault them for that. Violet is thinking for herself, dealing with drama and trauma from all ends and learning more about how her world really works. The character building, world building and overall plot is thickening so book three cannot come at a better time. The romance scenes are again quite graphic so for those who enjoy that type of reading material, you will not be disappointed. I still say the author could do without all the details of the romance scenes and still have a magnificent and successful series. To each their own. Overall I enjoyed this book just as I did the first. I give this book 5 out of 5 stairs.","<span>I'll start by saying I cannot wait for book 3.

R1CTRQPV4UHONH,"Incredible, 7/5 Stars!","This book was incredible! It is exactly what I look for in a fantasy/romance/war series. The fact that this author takes her time in laying the groundwork and developing her characters in a way that doesn't feel dragged out or unneeded while also completely submersing you in the romance and battle scenes with so much anxiety and tension is truly a work of art. There were times I didn't think I could read fast enough because the scene was so explosive and imaginative. It truly was a rollercoaster of emotions; laughter, heartbreak, comradery, confusion, love, epiphanies, sorrow, hate. The list goes on. Safe to say I was never bored. The integrity Rebecca maintains in this world is extremely notable. This may be a fantasy/romance series, but it's also war and it's cruel. That makes the stakes so much higher and the way she makes her readers feel that emotion says everything about her writing and storytelling. I've seen several people say they hated the ending and that upsets me. The ending was SUBLIME! I want to be shocked. I want to be floored. I want to have never guessed that's how it could have gone and that is what Rebecca delivers. Kudos to you, Rebecca Yarros. I will be spending the next 9 months theorizing what happens all for her to probably shock me to my core again.

I have many thoughts so I'm going to try and narrow it down to the most important things but I feel like this is still going to be all over the place.  The pacing of this story was immaculate! There was not a moment where I was bored and waiting for the story to pick up or there were any scenes that didn't pertain to the overall plot. Everything was happening so fast throughout the story and yet it still felt like it was showing the information that was needed to keep the story rolling. I was unable to put this book down, while I was at work I had to force myself to stop reading to answer calls when they came in and I hardly ever have this issue. I went on a trip with some friends and I was so excited to have a few hours of reading time on the plane and then my silly little self was in too much of a hurry to get out of the car at the airport that I left my book in the car *cue the beginning of a mental breakdown in the TSA line* I kid you not I was racing through the airport to find a store that had a copy because there was no way I was going to be able to wait 3 days before picking it back up. It has been so long since I have felt that compelled by a book to go out of my way and buy a second copy and paying double what I paid for my preorder.  So much happens and every chapter I was going ""what the heck?!"" So many twists and turns that I did not see coming, some came no where close to crossing my mind of being a possibility. There was so much mental screaming going on I thought my head would explode. I'm normally a very quite reader, I make faces while reading things but very rarely do I make any audible noises and let me tell you this book got me.

I do have one issue with this installment and it is Violet being really annoying about her relationship/ not relationship with Xaden. She was constantly going back and forth and I'm just like.... girl please get it together. Like I get it but also there are more important things that need attention other than your relationship crisis. I'm hoping with this ending of this book that that issue has been solved because there is nothing else Xaden can do to prove to Violet that he is hers and trusts her completely.  I love the Sorrengail siblings, their relationship reminded me a lot of my sibling and I... you know minus the one of use pretending to be dead for 6 years. Also Mira decking Brennen in the nose upon first seeing him killed me cause that is 100% something I would do in that situation lmao.

I don’t know if that’s the best thing I did or the worst cause I knew I was getting a cliffhanger at the end of this book (series always do cliffhangers 😭) or the one of my great ones cause at least now I can satiate my curiosity about what happens on this book. I should have held myself back and waited for the third book to at least come out cause that ending, while I knew was gonna be a cliffhanger, was not it. I need answers and a continuation now please, thank you very much 😩😂  Putting aside that one, the read was enjoyable and although this book frustrated me so much that is had me hitting my pillow so much that I think that if there was a pillow justice system, my pillow would have cold the pillow cops on me to get me arrested for hitting them so much. That’s how frustrated I became when reading this book.  I mean, I get where Violet and Xaden was coming from (kinda) but the “You need to ask me, Violet” Xaden was REALLY NOT IT for this book. I love the man but I found that there was a lot of the time I wanted to jumped into the book and pull the man’s hair to release the annoyance I felt during those moments. Don’t even get me started on Violet. I love the girl (I really do) but she needs to get a grip—I’m done (zipping up my mouth or stopping my fingers from typing, whichever is fine) I’m not ranting anymore cause my heart is pumping so much for some reason (I think it might have to do with the cliffhanger but I’m not diving into that again 😂) and I am so glad that I don’t have to do anything tomorrow cause now I’ll be up all night thinking about what could possibly happen on the next book 😂  Anyways, I give it a 3 stars cause I did enjoy it but I felt like this could have been better.","<span>Held off reading this since last year and finally had the time to actually pick it up and read it.

Violet goes through a lot and I really loved the struggle with her. Her feeling like a failure made her realistic and I really appreciated that. I also love her motivation for everything she is doing. Violet is a beautiful female character.  I can’t wait for the next book! And I also want to state that I’m very intrigued by Aaric. I need more of him. :) The dragons are also one of my favorite parts of the book! I adoreeee them.  All in all it gets a 4, whereas the first book gets a 5 because I was on the edge of my seat the entire time with book one. This book was a little bit of a struggle throughout until the end when things finally felt like they were moving. I also struggled not getting as much Xedon in this book.

R2AACHOBR3KMKF,Good but not as good as the first one,"1. The whole premise of the conflict that led to the rebellion was faulty for me. Because to be honest, I totally can understand why a country would choose to protect its citizens. NO country would open up its people to an undefeatable danger for the sake of saving another country. Its silly. 2. That being said. It was still ridiculous that Navarra would choose to keep their people ignorant. The realistic thing would be to use the outside danger as a rallying point for the people and justification for the rulers’ positions. That the author chose to have the leaders keep people ignorant didn’t make sense to me. It wasn’t even a strategic decision. Maybe it will become clearer in later books I don’t know. But I doubt I will still remember the series well enough to be interested in picking up a continuation in a year or so. This is why I generally don’t pick incomplete series and when I do so it is a mistake—one which I sorely regret for this book. 3. I love love in my books so I am always happy to have a serious against all odds romance like Xaden and Violet’s but the juvenile angst in the Xaden-Violet relationship just got too silly for me in this book. And the cliché of Violet being the silly one wanst lost on me.it always surprises me how authors write badass female characters sho somehow should go against the gender styreotypes. But they always make them play into the styreotypes on the character front. They are always the irrational ones, constantly making unrealistic demands – how do you give a leader of a movement an ultimatum in your relationship because you insist he gives you all his secrets EVEN if they endanger other people’s lives. She was unable to shield but still wanted to be trusted with the rebellion and Xaden’s full secrets. I mean COME ON! This all felt out of place in a clearly adult age group book. It’s the sort of thing I expect in young adult. How do you get angry with someone for keeping a secret that could get them killed?? That being said, I still deemed it a 3.5 for the creative world and magic system. It really is promising if she can give us a more mature, more strategic and less whiney female lead next time. I just hope I will still remember the first two books by then.","<span>1. The whole premise of the conflict that led to the rebellion was faulty for me.

I love how she uses her brains when her body won’t cooperate. And those dragons! I love the dragons!  Some people have really criticized this book and compared it directly to the first, Fourth Wing. That is a huge mistake in my opinion. This series is going to be at least 4, maybe 5 books in all. The end of Iron Flame is nowhere near the end of the whole story. I think it was great as a bridge to the next. And after that shocker of an ending I can’t wait to see what happens.

I loved the book and give it 5/5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  “Everyone expected Violet Sorrengail to die during her first year at Basgiath War College—Violet included. But Threshing was only the first impossible test meant to weed out the weak-willed, the unworthy, and the unlucky. Now the real training begins, and Violet’s already wondering how she’ll get through. It’s not just that it’s grueling and maliciously brutal, or even that it’s designed to stretch the riders’ capacity for pain beyond endurance. It’s the new vice commandant, who’s made it his personal mission to teach Violet exactly how powerless she is–unless she betrays the man she loves. Although Violet’s body might be weaker and frailer than everyone else’s, she still has her wits—and a will of iron. And leadership is forgetting the most important lesson Basgiath has taught her: Dragon riders make their own rules. But a determination to survive won’t be enough this year. Because Violet knows the real secret hidden for centuries at Basgiath War College—and nothing, not even dragon fire, may be enough to save them in the end.”","<span>My mind was reeling when I finished Iron Flame.

I spent most of it wondering who was going to die next.  Rebecca really went for “how can I stress out my readers the most?”  Oh Violet.

When he goes all in he goes ALL in …..literally 😭 I’m broken. I’m broken beyond repair and idk  Tairn. Yo Tairn really upped his sass game this book. The dragon arrogance was on POINT. Watching him defend Violet made my heart swell  Fourth Wing: Rhi, Ridoc, and Sawyer. I spent way too much time expecting one of these people to die. I love them too much. I don’t want to lose them. Please don’t take them away from me.  The first years were interesting this year. I will admit the two we got to know were veeeerrrryyy conveniently placed in the story. I’m interested to see how they will continue. I especially want to see Aaric’s signet manifest and what that will be.  Andarna: girl I knew it!! I knew this girl was special. The thing with the scales right away said she was different. Omg tho, was not expecting that outcome with the whole waiting for Violet thing. Really made Violent into that typical YA-fantasy chosen-one trope there. Idk how I feel about that.  This book was way too fast paced. I don’t want to say it was too long…but it felt long. And I read this in like 3 days. This was a lot. I mean I’ll likely continue the series but I won’t lie, with everything going on around Rebecca Yarros, I’ll keep getting my content from the library.","<span>Holy flaming hot chetos, what did I just read? -spoilers ahead-<br><br>This entire book was so stressful!!

RNWANLX30TCXN,You cannot convince me that she didn't write this with AI,"SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS - Still actively reading, but I need to rant.  I am about halfway through this book but wanted to start writing a review now so I don't forget anything.  First off, I think it is a little funny that when the group of cadets is discussing the unity of Navarre they're discussing how a language was lost among groups of people. That the unification only benefited three particular provinces. It has been irking me since I first read Fourth Wing that Yarros was using Gaelic incorrectly...and of course by now, I'm sure you've seen all the videos of true Gaelic speakers bringing awareness to this. Yet, she actively chooses to be ignorant by mispronouncing not only the language entirely, but the dialect. And she literally put it in her book. So, she knows what she is doing.  Second, Violet has got to be the most obnoxious character I have ever read. The way she is so mad about Xaden keeping things from her is outrageous. If we look at the big picture, the two hardly know anything about each other. Why she thinks she has earned the right to know all of his secrets is beyond me. And same, that he doesn't deserve to know any of hers outright. But she is behaving like a spoiled brat. Thousands of lives are at stake and she's pissy that he won't tell her this info, knowing she can slip. (Which she does. She spills the beans to all of her friends. It is a good thing he didn't trust her to keep her mouth shut, because she can't. I don't care the intentions.) And when she does spill the beans, she gets irritated that her friends aren't blowing up and furious at her the way she is at Xaden. (You'd think she would realize that makes her the problem, but no.)  Third, this book is absolutely filler. I'm at page 274 currently and at least 100 pages could have been cut out. The whole back and forth of Violet and Xaden arguing, but not really making any progress is redundant. Why this wasn't condensed is beyond me.  Fourth, ward keys? Really? She couldn't come up with any thing else? Couldn't try to call them something even a little different? Previously a lot of readers mentioned there were parallels to SJMaas's ACOTAR books. I didn't catch it in Fourth Wing (and maybe that's because I was listening to the audiobook on double the speed so I wouldn't have to hear how stuffy the narrator was) but there are significant elements that stand out to me now in Iron Flames. I can see several from ACOTAR and TOG.  As of right now this book is getting two stars and that is being generous.  UPDATE:  Wow, now Violet has siphons just like the bat boys. And listen, I know in some books there will be similarities. It happens. The Fourth Wing story is an easy read. It doesn't deep dive into fantasy the way most books do within its genre so maybe I should have expected this. But there are too many similarities from Maas's work that are blatant. Again I'm wondering where a proper editor was so something like this could have been avoided.  So far, I have not read anything unique in either of these books. So far, there is nothing original. Nothing has wowed me. I do like Xaden. I think he is a fun and strong character. It is really hard to root for Violet. At this point, I would be happy if she was written off (and somehow the dragons and Xaden live) and someone else take the spotlight.  Ok, we are around page 500 and things have started to pick up. This book is all drama. As if we didn't have enough of it already, insert Cat who is a b*tch just because she can be. Just goes back to that I don't feel this is a true rep of fantasy. Fantasy is an element, of course, but sometimes I feel like I'm reading some cheap reality show. And Violet....Lord have mercy. Violet is still a loose cannon and not in a Rin type of way from The Poppy War. She's a loose cannon because she continues to act like she is thirteen years old and can't take accountability for her own actions. And the rare occasions that she does, she just throws a pity party.  FINAL UPDATE: Ok I finished it and my gosh....it did not get better. I'm leaving this at a two star review and that is being VERY generous.  Now that we know Xaden turns venin...did anyone else catch this is exactly what happens to Dmitri in Vampire Academy? Where he is reluctantly turned strigoi and in Blood Promise Rose has to off him? I would not be surprised if in the third or fourth book that Xaden is written off. At the very least, this is another blatant similarity to another well established book and author.  If this comes out that any sort of AI was used to write this book, I will not be surprised. Disappointed, but not surprised. WHERE WERE THE EDITORS???? Scenes should have been cut entirely, these similarities could have been handled better (if they truly were not stolen) and rewritten, dialogue was cringe. I saw someone else mention that she wondered about the AI, if not a ghost writer. Something is up with this book and not in a good way. I believe Red Tower is pushing so hard for a money grab that quantity became more important than quality.  Violet's character development continues to go downhill. (And again, this isn't the masterpiece chaotic development that Kuang used for Rin. This is just...awful and embarrassing.) Cat is still an unnecessary character that I believe was thrown in for the reality TV lovers, the readers that crave drama. Xaden is the glue holding this story together and if she does go the same route that Richelle Meade took, then the series is in trouble. (As if it isn't already.) This was a filler book that deserved more time and effort.  Worst book I've read in a long while.","<span>SPOILERS ** SPOILERS ** SPOILERS - Still actively reading, but I need to rant.<br><br>I am about halfway through this book but wanted to start writing a review now so I don't forget anything.<br><br>First off, I think it is a little funny that when the group of cadets is discussing the unity of Navarre they're discussing how a language was lost among groups of people.

Yes Would I read this book again? Yes Will I continue the series? Yes, can’t wait Will I read from this author again? Yes  I am all about escapism and this story does just that. For a little while, I can escape to this beautifully crafted world full of action packed adventure, love, and fantasy. I don’t care what anyone else says, this story checks all my boxes. That being said, I loved the whole cast of characters. The deaths of some characters were shocking and some others were surprising. It felt very GOT in the fact that I didn’t want to love a character too much because I wasn’t sure if they were going to survive. Violet kind of started to annoy me with the whole tell me all your secrets and do it right now to Xaden. They just started a relationship. No one tells all their secrets right away in a new relationship. They come out gradually and over time. That’s a natural progression. Other than that, loved Vi. Xaden was amazing as always. Just loving Violet and doing everything he can to protect her and tell her what secrets he could. The letter passing back and forth was so romantic. He became overprotective at one point, but Violet put him in his place. Loved that scene. I love that she never backs down when she feels she is right and is passionate about something. I missed that he didn’t call her Violence much at all. This book had its spicy moments but wasn’t all that spicy which was fine with me. They were in the middle of so much war and action that who would have the time. When they did find the time is was Hawt. Honestly, this book is so good I could have gone spice free and still been 5 stars. The plot was action packed, constantly changing and new revelations being made. So much happened I’m still wrapping my mind around it. One plot hole that bugged me and it may be *spoiler* so stop reading here if you don’t want to know. The wards were failing in Aretia and they fell in Basgiath and Vi said she could only save one of them. Why? Why couldn’t Andarna do both with her fire? Basgiath was chosen. So what happens to Aretia? Since some dragon hatchlings chose to hatch there it has restored the magic there. What is going to happen to the hatching grounds at Aretia now that the wards will fail? This is just a huge plot hole to me and I will definitely be disappointed if it isn’t covered in the next book.","<span>Epic fantasy<br>Romantasy<br>War college<br>Dragons<br>Dragon riders<br>Magic<br>Cutthroat<br>Battles<br>Secrets<br>Touch her and die<br>Smart FMC<br>Gryphons<br>FMC living with physical disorder<br>High stakes<br>Found family<br>Corruption<br>Betrayal<br>Torture<br>Morally gray MMC<br>Shadow Daddy<br>Cliffhanger<br>Second book in a series<br>Spice: 2.75/5<br><br>FMC: Violet Sorrengail<br>MMC: Xaden Riorson<br><br>Did I enjoy the book?

He addresses what he calls Zombie Lies, nonsense that refuses to die no matter how often it is debunked. He addresses the urgency to address climate change and our failure to do so. He makes fun of the sanctimonious hypocrisy in show business, media and society, the racket our universities have turned into, cancel culture, the new attacks on free speech, and he addresses the problems with the Republican party as well as the Democratic party. He brings up a lot of important points that we typically avoid talking about, or can’t even talk honestly about without being shamed, all while adding compelling insights. In the last chapter he has an important message for all of us.  In the past I did not always agree with Bill Maher, especially the period when I was a staunch Republican (centrist now), and I also don’t agree with a lot of aspects of his lifestyle, but I’ve always found him to be funny and smart. I laughed out loud on every page. In fact, I do not recommend that you read this book in public places. People may think you are crazy for sitting somewhere and continuously chuckling to yourself, or mistake you for a Hyena, depending on how your laughter sounds like. I also found that I agreed with almost everything he said. There were a few things I did not agree with him on, but I forgive him for being wrong a few times.

R5NJJVZDZ4LY5,An Insiders Look At One Of The Most Important Rooms In The US,"Many people only know George Stephanopoulos from hosting a morning TV show, but he previously served as a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton. Now drawing on his experience and insider knowledge plus information from many interviews, his book The Situation Room: The Inside Story of Presidents in Crisis provides an in-depth exploration of the White House Situation Room, detailing its evolution and pivotal role in American crises. From its inception after the Bay of Pigs fiasco to its digital transformation in 2023, the book examines how presidents and their advisers have used this critical space for decision-making during significant historical events. Through personal anecdotes and interviews, Stephanopoulos reveals both the technological advancements and the human elements that have shaped the Sit Room’s function in handling nuclear scares, terrorist attacks, wars, and political scandals.  Initially resembling a mundane corporate meeting room, it gradually evolved into a high-tech command center. The book tracks its role from the Vietnam War and the collapse of the Soviet Union to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the operation to kill Osama bin Laden. The book also touches on notable moments such as the near-nuclear confrontation during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, the hostage crisis on the day of Reagan’s inauguration, and the immediate chaos following the 9/11 attacks.  The Sit Room's transformation over the decades reflects advances in technology and the increasing complexity of global threats. By 2023, it had become a digitally advanced, ergonomically designed complex known as the WHSR. Despite these advancements, Stephanopoulos feels nostalgic for the earlier, less sophisticated days. Through his detailed account, the book captures the essence of the Sit Room as both a symbol of presidential power and a crucial element in safeguarding national security.  Five Highlights  1. Creation and Evolution: The Sit Room was created after the Bay of Pigs fiasco to centralize information and improve presidential decision-making. Initially a plain meeting room, it has evolved into a sophisticated command center.  2. Technological Advances: From handwritten notes and typewriters to computers and video teleconferencing, the Sit Room's technology has significantly advanced, culminating in its 2023 transformation into the WHSR.  3. Crisis Management: The book covers major historical events managed from the Sit Room, such as the Vietnam War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the operation to kill Osama bin Laden.  4. Presidential Styles: Stephanopoulos provides insights into the different management styles of presidents, from Nixon’s incapacitation during the Yom Kippur War to Obama’s handling of communication with Vladimir Putin.  5. Human Element: Despite technological advancements, the human element remains crucial. The book highlights moments of tension, humor, and camaraderie among Sit Room staff and presidents, illustrating the room's role in American governance.  The most important lesson from Stephanopoulos’ The Situation Room is the critical importance of effective communication and centralized information in crisis management. The evolution of the Sit Room underscores how technological advancements have enhanced decision-making capabilities, but it also highlights that the human elements of leadership, judgment, and collaboration are irreplaceable in navigating complex global crises.","<span>Many people only know George Stephanopoulos from hosting a morning TV show, but he previously served as a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton. Now drawing on his experience and insider knowledge plus information from many interviews, his book The Situation Room: The Inside Story of Presidents in Crisis provides an in-depth exploration of the White House Situation Room, detailing its evolution and pivotal role in American crises. From its inception after the Bay of Pigs fiasco to its digital transformation in 2023, the book examines how presidents and their advisers have used this critical space for decision-making during significant historical events. Through personal anecdotes and interviews, Stephanopoulos reveals both the technological advancements and the human elements that have shaped the Sit Room’s function in handling nuclear scares, terrorist attacks, wars, and political scandals.<br><br>Initially resembling a mundane corporate meeting room, it gradually evolved into a high-tech command center. The book tracks its role from the Vietnam War and the collapse of the Soviet Union to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the operation to kill Osama bin Laden. The book also touches on notable moments such as the near-nuclear confrontation during the Yom Kippur War in 1973, the hostage crisis on the day of Reagan’s inauguration, and the immediate chaos following the 9/11 attacks.<br><br>The Sit Room's transformation over the decades reflects advances in technology and the increasing complexity of global threats. By 2023, it had become a digitally advanced, ergonomically designed complex known as the WHSR. Despite these advancements, Stephanopoulos feels nostalgic for the earlier, less sophisticated days. Through his detailed account, the book captures the essence of the Sit Room as both a symbol of presidential power and a crucial element in safeguarding national security.<br><br>Five Highlights<br><br>1. Creation and Evolution: The Sit Room was created after the Bay of Pigs fiasco to centralize information and improve presidential decision-making. Initially a plain meeting room, it has evolved into a sophisticated command center.<br><br>2. Technological Advances: From handwritten notes and typewriters to computers and video teleconferencing, the Sit Room's technology has significantly advanced, culminating in its 2023 transformation into the WHSR.<br><br>3. Crisis Management: The book covers major historical events managed from the Sit Room, such as the Vietnam War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the operation to kill Osama bin Laden.<br><br>4. Presidential Styles: Stephanopoulos provides insights into the different management styles of presidents, from Nixon’s incapacitation during the Yom Kippur War to Obama’s handling of communication with Vladimir Putin.<br><br>5. Human Element: Despite technological advancements, the human element remains crucial. The book highlights moments of tension, humor, and camaraderie among Sit Room staff and presidents, illustrating the room's role in American governance.<br><br>The most important lesson from Stephanopoulos’ The Situation Room is the critical importance of effective communication and centralized information in crisis management. The evolution of the Sit Room underscores how technological advancements have enhanced decision-making capabilities, but it also highlights that the human elements of leadership, judgment, and collaboration are irreplaceable in navigating complex global crises.</span>",5,False,True,us,False,9,1,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2024",2024-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,DES,,,1538740761,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5NJJVZDZ4LY5?ASIN=1538740761,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFNJKYH66SFNFFY2BRO34Z5TWNXQ,AFNJKYH66SFNFFY2BRO34Z5TWNXQ,[{'link': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51UKmRC5nsL.jpg'}],,

RWT7GFLPGA6YR,The History of the Situation Room,"My thanks to author George Stephanopoulos, Grand Central Publishing, and NetGalley for the opportunity to review an ARC of this new book. I attest this review is my own unbiased and objective work.  We've all heard of the White House Situation Room. What we lacked was an understanding of when and how the Situation Room evolved over the course of time. The research behind this book consisted of numerous documents and interviews with the actual participants and people who worked in the Situation Room. Author and broadcaster George Stephanopoulos guides the reader through the development and history of the Situation Room (hereafter abbreviated as SR) through the past eleven Presidencies in this highly readable and interesting new book.  Starting with the Kennedy administration, we learn how the SR operated in a very crude manner in the time it took to relay information primarily through a system of telephone lines, which may have helped contribute to the Bay of Pigs debacle early in JFK's presidency. This was inferred from reading the text, not explicitly stated by the author. From there the SR is examined from the Johnson to the current Biden presidencies.  There are many remarkable moments in the book depending on your own perspective of history. For me the most interesting chapters were those devoted to the two Bush presidencies (for GHW Bush the fall of the Berlin Wall, collapse of the USSR; for GW Bush the story of 9/11 and its aftermath). However, there are many other interesting stories such as LBJ's obsession with the Vietnam War; the Mayaguez Incident in the Ford years; and the rogue actions by Oliver North that took place during the Reagan White House.  There is also a very interesting juxtaposition of the parallel events involving Operation Eagle Claw in the Carter administration to try and rescue hostages in Iran, and Operation Neptune Spear which resulted in the assassination of Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan. A central character in these chapters is Robert Gates, former US Defense Secretary who was a witness to both the failed and successful raids.  I am a big fan of Presidential History and was excited to have the chance to read the book. I found it very well written and engaging, and highly recommend it if interested in the subject.  @GrandCentralpub","<span>My thanks to author George Stephanopoulos, Grand Central Publishing, and NetGalley for the opportunity to review an ARC of this new book.

Now most nights I will say “do you want to do the book?” And he will say “yes” or” a short one.” This really gets him thinking and remembering stories to share from the past. Instead of sending it to him to fill out, which I knew he would probably never do, it works out perfectly for me to keep the book and ask him questions over the phone. I bring it with me when I go to visit him and we will sometimes do a question after dinner. Just about the only reason why I can get him to turn off the TV for a few minutes!</span>",5,False,True,us,False,6,3,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2022",2022-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,Paulette Zak,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/ce735131-c025-4605-a736-6540a6659322._CR0,0,1080,1080_SX48_.jpg",59.0,1070527718,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGZBUWP8Q08T1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1070527718,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFAK6O7MQ6ZSE3XRFOIXTQHXODOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AFAK6O7MQ6ZSE3XRFOIXTQHXODOA,,,

R38BMMPT9R6D5F,An amazing book to keep you well and healthy,"I brought this book to help keep me on the right track to be more healthy and to lose weight that had crept back on over the 2020 lockdown.  After watching Michael Moseley's programme recently aired in July/Aug, I knew this would be the right thing to help me.  Through the entire month of May 2020, I exercised everyday - be it walking, running, trail running, cycling and Hiit workouts and I felt so deflated at the end of May when I felt I had put more weight on than off. (I don't own scales, I go on my clothes and I struggled to fit in anything, which is depressing).  After watching Michael's program, I realised that it's what I am or not eating, so I ordered his new book.  The book is full of facts and credible evidence as why rapid weight loss is best, getting active, the diet in practice recipe's and meal planners. Michael explains the process and flexibility to it, for those who may not be able to do the fast 800. You can do TRE (time restricted Eating) where you eat during a time period so your body fasts over the rest, and when you are sleeping, so eating breakfast a little later or dinner a little earlier. The 5:2, 2:5, 6:1 ect where your fast days are just healthy low carb Mediterranean 800 cal meals.  There's plenty of meal ideas at the back to keep you going and of course you can look at other recipes on the fast 800 website and in other cookbooks.  It's suggested to write down what you consume during the fast 800, which is what I am doing and Calorie counting, until I get to my idea weight and the I'll maintain the diet with a 5:2 or 6:1 and continue to eat healthy. I weigh-in with a family member who is also doing this diet, to keep us both motivated.  A very good read for anyone who wants to be well, healthy and maintain wellbeing.","<span>I brought this book to help keep me on the right track to be more healthy and to lose weight that had crept back on over the 2020 lockdown.<br><br>After watching Michael Moseley's programme recently aired in July/Aug, I knew this would be the right thing to help me.<br><br>Through the entire month of May 2020, I exercised everyday - be it walking, running, trail running, cycling and Hiit workouts and I felt so deflated at the end of May when I felt I had put more weight on than off.

R12LSQS5TH6B4D,"Good on science, sensible programme that works, dull recipes, more needed on behaviour modification.","If you are sceptical of diet lore, so-called 'clean' eating and every other fad that's out there, then this book, an update on previous work by Dr Moseley, will be reassuring. The author has revised his original 5:2 programme, based on what he's learned from current research. You don't have to be a science nerd to realise that Moseley is making a genuine attempt to inform readers on how proper scientific research is conducted. There's a helpful section at the back on clinical trials. Issues such as sample size, replication and peer-review of research are important in verifying claims on particular methods of food restriction.  Publishers, of course, want books to make money, so the latest from Dr Moseley, after 5:2, Blood Sugar Diet and Clever Guts, revises earlier assumptions and tailors a diet based on Mediterranean eating that is restricted to 800 calories a day, eaten within a short window of 12 hours or fewer. It's heavy on ketosis, so if you have had your fill of the Keto diet, perhaps this is not for you. It advises on cutting down on 'white carbs' and sugar. It follows the dictum of a famous neurologist who was asked the key to a long and healthy life: ""eat lots of plants; move more"". The book has a lot of advice on exercise which is a little limited. I think more options could have been briefly outlined so adherents don't feel that they have to do spin classes. Although walking is advocated, I think there could have been more on this. Not everyone will be motivated by HIIT - although it really does work - and will want options.  The diet is flexible: one can stay on 800 per day for as little as two weeks or as much as 8 weeks, then head to 5:2 fasting. The author provides options to be tailored to personal needs.  The range of food available on the diet is wide. You don't have to eat ghastly brown rice or wholemeal pasta, even though the author is a fan. There are other ways of getting slow-release carbs that are less 'diet-dreary'. There are some interesting recipes (the pistachio chocolate and chilli snack is lovely) but many of the options are unimaginative. A diet of this sort could be full of great options. The ones in '800' are an improvement on the 'Clever Guts' recipes which were uninspiring, to say the least. One can still restrict calories, carbs and sugar without having a repetitive and dull diet full of wholegrain pasta and brown rice.  What's a little scant is how behaviour modification works. Dr Moseley is reassuring on willpower. There could, however, be more on eating behaviours and how to modify them. This is where the Beck Diet is effective. The Beck Diet Workbook is a great option on eating behaviour.  My suggestion is: embrace the diet, pay attention to the science, look at other, similar (low carb, protein-rich, calorie-controlled) more imaginative recipes/plans than the ones in the book. If you are a good cook, you can probably work it out yourself without compromising on calories by using spices more effectively. Have a look at The Healthy Food Guide Magazine for ideas if you are not a confident cook. You don't HAVE to have chia seeds and turmeric and take out a mortgage for the avocados.  No doubt next year's offering will bring more revelations about 'diet-science' and a slightly different direction. Remember, however committed works like these are to promoting sensible eating guided by sound science, they are still commercial products designed to make money. If you're unsure about committing to buying this book, borrow it from the library or wait until about April when the January dieters donate their books to charity shops. The book is worth a read and helpful. The diet will work, as will all restrictive eating plans but this provides a balanced nutritional plan, if unimaginative in execution.

R1KIQSVK4B3DDA,Brilliant book and knowledgable author,"I usually struggle to stay interested in books that are medical or non-fiction as most are written in a manner which is very much textbook style, but I must admit this one had me captivated from the word go & I read it all in an afternoon. I found the info interesting and relevant and felt so inspired by his writing that I actually started the diet the next day. I feel more educated and knowledgeable on this lifestyle and how and why it works, which I like as I am the type of person that doesn’t like the concept of “because it just does” - I want to understand the how and whys of things. Dr Mosley’s writing style grabbed my attention and made this an enjoyable read and not just another text book. I happily paid for the book over some of the free titles, after reading the first few chapters as a kindle sample because I found it interesting and fact based. There’s another book I tried reading where the author (not a Doctor either) admits they tried the diet but couldn’t stick to it, but then carried on writing diet recipes. That to me is not a good example - with Dr Mosley’s work however, he has tried all the things he has written about so he not only knows the science behind them but also how it feels to actually do them. That I can get behind and totally respect. He’s not a “do as I say, not as I do” author but has really been there and tried it before sitting claiming to be an expert (not that he makes that claim) as such I already have his other books on my wish list. I told my partner about this book and gave him the summary of it and he also decided to join me in becoming a 5:2er. I’m impressed how dedicated he is to it, so now we have changed our eating times to between 12:00 and 20:00 and also have 2 days a week where we fast, and both are seeing improvements in many areas. Now others at work have expressed and interest in our new eating habits and want to know more, so I am recommending this book to them to also try. Good book and reasonably priced.  UPDATE: 3 weeks in on this diet come new lifestyle, and my partner has lost a stone and I have lost half a stone (which is about right given he is heavier than me and Male and we are both eating approx the same amount of calories). By simply reducing what we eat twice a week and watching the times we eat within, has done us wonders. Granted we both miss our late night dinners (due to shifts we were eating at 21:30 in the evenings most nights) so we feel cheated out of a meal, purely because we haven’t adjusted mentally to the fact we are now just eating it earlier in the day. We aim to have our first meal around 12:30/13:00 and the last one by 19:30 and that seems to be working. We’ve also noticed that even though 5 days are pretty much eating what we want, we are more conscious of what we are eating, selecting healthier meals & ditching the junk. It’s made us more aware of what crap we were eating and now we have cut a lot of rubbish out completely without really much thought. This book has changed our lives for the better in such a short space of time. Thank you Dr Mosley.","<span>I usually struggle to stay interested in books that are medical or non-fiction as most are written in a manner which is very much textbook style, but I must admit this one had me captivated from the word go &amp; I read it all in an afternoon.<br>I found the info interesting and relevant and felt so inspired by his writing that I actually started the diet the next day.<br>I feel more educated and knowledgeable on this lifestyle and how and why it works, which I like as I am the type of person that doesn’t like the concept of “because it just does” - I want to understand the how and whys of things.<br>Dr Mosley’s writing style grabbed my attention and made this an enjoyable read and not just another text book. I happily paid for the book over some of the free titles, after reading the first few chapters as a kindle sample because I found it interesting and fact based.<br>There’s another book I tried reading where the author (not a Doctor either) admits they tried the diet but couldn’t stick to it, but then carried on writing diet recipes. That to me is not a good example - with Dr Mosley’s work however, he has tried all the things he has written about so he not only knows the science behind them but also how it feels to actually do them. That I can get behind and totally respect. He’s not a “do as I say, not as I do” author but has really been there and tried it before sitting claiming to be an expert (not that he makes that claim) as such I already have his other books on my wish list.<br>I told my partner about this book and gave him the summary of it and he also decided to join me in becoming a 5:2er. I’m impressed how dedicated he is to it, so now we have changed our eating times to between 12:00 and 20:00 and also have 2 days a week where we fast, and both are seeing improvements in many areas. Now others at work have expressed and interest in our new eating habits and want to know more, so I am recommending this book to them to also try.<br>Good book and reasonably priced.<br><br>UPDATE: 3 weeks in on this diet come new lifestyle, and my partner has lost a stone and I have lost half a stone (which is about right given he is heavier than me and Male and we are both eating approx the same amount of calories). By simply reducing what we eat twice a week and watching the times we eat within, has done us wonders. Granted we both miss our late night dinners (due to shifts we were eating at 21:30 in the evenings most nights) so we feel cheated out of a meal, purely because we haven’t adjusted mentally to the fact we are now just eating it earlier in the day. We aim to have our first meal around 12:30/13:00 and the last one by 19:30 and that seems to be working. We’ve also noticed that even though 5 days are pretty much eating what we want, we are more conscious of what we are eating, selecting healthier meals &amp; ditching the junk. It’s made us more aware of what crap we were eating and now we have cut a lot of rubbish out completely without really much thought. This book has changed our lives for the better in such a short space of time. Thank you Dr Mosley.</span>",5,False,True,gb,False,7,1,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 August 2019,2019-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,Kuromi,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/165debfb-0303-4771-82fe-eacd5f610d36._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",44.0,1780723628,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R1KIQSVK4B3DDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780723628,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEDIS24EW4OMVBESXI5MO2TTSLKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AEDIS24EW4OMVBESXI5MO2TTSLKA,,,

RAY5VVD29BCRD,Updated advice,"I've read most of Dr Michael Mosley's previous books and found this to be a good update. It provides a mixture of Michael's experience, the latest research and some real-life case studies as well as a recommended (but non-prescriptive) programme. Some of it is familiar and some advice has changed (e.g. up the calories on 5:2 to make it more achievable and to get more nutrients). It's quite a quick read as well (and half is made up of recipes but they sound tasty).  Michael Mosley has used the experience and knowledge gained over the last few years since The Fast Diet (5:2) plus I finished the book feeling quite motivated to get started.  In summary, if you've got a lot of weight to lose, try: - 800 calories a day of a Mediterranean-style diet. Review your progress and goals after two weeks and either continue for up to twelve weeks or move to New 5:2. - 5:2 until you reach your goals. - Med-style eating in the main for maintenance (maybe with one fast day for health reasons and easier maintenance).  Other recommendations are included, such as time-restricted eating and exercise suggestions.  A lot of it will be familiar if you've read previous books, but it does provide updated research and is definitely worth a read if you want a boost and a little convincing to get started.  As another reviewer has said, there is some encouragement to go to their website. This was the same in previous books but unlike e.g. the blood sugar diet website you can't get to forums and some info unless you pay to go on their 12 week programme.","<span>I've read most of Dr Michael Mosley's previous books and found this to be a good update.

RQ65DZU24SB9D,Excellent book; let down somewhat by sloppy editing,"Just how good a communicator Mosley is will become clear very quickly if you try to listen to some of the scientists doing the research on fasting (who talk about RAS, IGF-1, and pathways, etc., as if those meant anything to a layperson). He really is very good, and this is definitely a book worth getting and using.  But there are areas where Mosley has been let down by sloppy editing. To start with, the term 'fast' is used in two quite different ways at different points in the book. It can mean going without any food at all, as in the 3-day 'fast' undertaken by Jenni Russell to cure her autoimmune disorder (let's call that a 'total fast') or the nightly total fast with time restricted eating. But it can also mean what Webster’s dictionary gives as a second definition, which is ‘to eat sparingly or abstain from some foods’--in other words, a 'fast' is a low-calorie diet for a period of time (call that a 'partial fast'; obviously that wouldn't work in the book's title, but a good editor might have suggested that in the text of the book the distinction would have helped to avoid confusion).  Other bad editing shows in the Endnotes: For example, the Jenni Russell story is fascinating to anyone who suffers from an autoimmune condition. But if you go to the reference cited, you find a subscription-only article on The Times website by Helena de Bertodano. If instead you google ‘Jenni Russell fast’, you can find Russell's own article on the Prolon website, which was written 2 months before the one in The Times. This is the sort of thing an editor is supposed to check.  Another confusion (took me awhile to get this straight in my head): --for intermittent fasting, 5:2 means eat on 5 days and observe a partial fast on 2 days (the subject of one of his earlier books, and developed further in this one); --for time restricted eating, 14:10 means the reverse: total fast for 14 hours (overnight), eat for 10 hours. Again, a good editor would have, for the purposes of this book, suggested that that pattern should be consistent: either eat:fast or fast:eat but not switching between the two.  Finally, to save you searching the website and then doing the maths: for the meal replacement shake on his website the800fast, it says that a small meal = ‘200kcal = 5 scoops (50g)'. That means a 400kcal portion = 100g. With 500g in a packet, that gives five 400kcal portions in each packet (which is not mentioned anywhere). That’s a bit expensive compared with what you can find on Amazon. Of course, it could be argued that the quality is better, but that would need to be spelled out, because a look at the ingredients for the different products available shows them to be much the same at less cost.

R287CDX3M0O7BL,6.8lb lost in a week- and still going down.,"I am really pleased I bought this book. I’ve tried most diets out there and end up giving up, either because it’s too complicated or because I don’t see results fast enough and I lose motivation. I found the case studies and research into rapid weight loss really interesting.  I’ve just reached the end of my first week of 800 cals a day. This is nowhere near as difficult as I thought. I haven’t been as strict on extra low carb count but I have cut out bread, pasta and rice. I had 2 small cheeky potatoes yesterday. Using MyFitnessPal to track my calories I’ve had no problem sticking to the 800 calories and have included a small glass of dry white wine in my allowance most days. I’m not going to lie there are a few days when I’ve felt really hungry and some where I’ve been tempted to scoff the contents of the waitrose cake aisle right there in the shop but it is getting easier and I’m getting to have an idea of the sorts of foods that fill me up better (quark is a lifesaver). I am also trying to do the time restricted eating and generally have a 16 hour fasting window. In my first week I’ve lost 6.8lb and guess I could’ve lost more if I’d reduced my carbs better and not had wine. I’m more than happy though and will continue this for a few more weeks before I switch to the ‘New 5:2’. If you’re looking for quick results that you can then make sustainable over time then this is for you. It doesn’t feel like a crash diet because it talks you through your maintenance plan and how to sustain it. I also bought the recipe book which has some nice ideas. I’ll update when I have more progress.  Edit : after 5 weeks I’ve lost almost a stone and have switched to the new 5:2. I’m still losing roughly 1lb per week this way. My weight loss isn’t spectacular but I don’t have much to lose and I lose weight very slowly so if it’s this fast for me, anyone else I’m sure will have really good results.","<span>I am really pleased I bought this book.

R3GI39N4WRFJFX,A bit disappointing,"I read the original Fast Diet book years ago and thought it was great. Even though a lot of the theories hadn't reached human trials at that time there was enough there that I gave it a go and successfully lost several stone.  A bad few years and lockdown has seen me gain a lot again so thought I'd give this new version a try.  There's more in here about observed effects of fasting in trials but it wasnt as satisfying a read. The first book really captured his enthusiasm for the subject, but this one felt more like an advert for his website and you could really tell his priorities had shifted.

R2YG6NWQJJBJYT,A Fascinating Look at the Science of Longevity — and How to Apply It,"Having been interested in longevity studies for over a decade, I was super excited to check out this book and learn more about intermittent fasting on a more basic level. Though a practitioner of intermittent fasting since 2014, I still had a lot to learn!  This book is well laid-out, easy to read, and well researched. I definitely wouldn’t recommend it for those with eating disorders (or those who have recently recovered), since calorie restriction, though without a pure weight loss focus, is a major theme throughout the book.  I found the emphasis on being realistically healthy and happy (without toxic positivity) refreshing for a health book.

R30BLG3YTOA2QE,It works - that's all you need to know.,"This book was a revelation to me. The first part of the book lays out the 'science' of following a ketogenic-style diet, and suggests different approaches you might adopt - some being easier than others. The second part is recipes, most of which I have not bothered with, though the portobello pizza is a winner.  I'm writing this review 41 days after following the fast800 diet, and can confirm this works superbly. I've now lost 22 pounds, but I did combine this with rigorous daily exercise so this speeded up the effect! Like all diets the Fast800 requires discipline and commitment, but this was so easy to follow largely because the rules are very simple. In my case, I skipped breakfast and only ate between 1pm and 7pm. Two main meals a day, no snacking, and daily exercise.  Why is this better than anything else I've tried? Firstly, because losing weight relatively quickly is extremely motivating and helps you keep going. Secondly, reducing calorie intake and dropping the carbs had an effect I wasn't anticipating - reduced hunger pangs and more energy! I think this is probably why low carb diets are becoming all the rage. I just didn't get the cravings I've experienced on other diets. Don't get me wrong - it's still tough to do this and will require consistent focus, but this is an eating program that presents you with rational choices and puts you firmly in control of your weight loss. Even better, it sets you up with a good strategy (5:2) to help you maintain the weight loss after the ""intense"" period is over. Good luck!","<span>This book was a revelation to me.

R6ODO5S6LYEVN,Incredible results!,"Bought this book with the Blood Sugar Diet, both by Dr Michael Mosley, to help me to get back on track after this lockdown year of little exercise/ not watching my diet. Had piled on 2 st 4lbs, but could not work out why. I had kept to low calorie/low fat foods, not realising the amount of carbs I was taking in. I read both books carefully, did all the planning ready to start, ie : getting rid of any foods I hoped not to eat, and taking stock. Followed the Fast 800 diet to the letter! As told, the gnawing hunger went after 48 hours, and I kept all meals within a 12 hour period. Started a week ago at 10.4 st, BMI : 30.30. Today, just 7 days later, the scales said 9.4st, and BMI down to 26.2. Whist I am not diabetic, my blood sugar levels were initially very high, now in a normal range. Still have a long way to go as I should weigh just under 8 stones, but this rapid weight loss (yes, I know, a lot of that is fluid) has given me the impetus to keep going. I used a combination of real protein and low carb veg, and very low carb protein drinks with added soluble fibre. My whole weeks shopping bill was only half what I'd normally spend on what I'd thought to be a sensible diet. Thank you Dr Mosley for showing me the correct/safe way to diet.","<span>Bought this book with the Blood Sugar Diet, both by Dr Michael Mosley, to help me to get back on track after this lockdown year of little exercise/ not watching my diet.

R2KPM6DYLVNZI2,This Works!,"This is the easiest and by far the most successful diet I have used to date. Supported and sited by research and a section with recipes to get you started it was an undemanding read that was simple and to the point. Relatively strict in it's purest form, I followed the recommended 800 calorie low carbohydrate phase with a sixteen hour fast window from the last meal, until the break of fast late morning and within a day, found that I did not go hungry. It took a good few weeks however, to finally break through the symptoms of what I presume are a kind of withdrawal of the sugar cravings/effects that left me with with itchy feet {of all things,} and cramping in my calves as well as headaches and a general feeling of fatigue and as if I was starting a bad cold without the snotty nose! I also stopped my major sugar craving within two days and after two months {9 weeks,} lost 1.5 stone! I have to say I have been very good on this regime with no lapses but then I did not find it hard and a vitamin/mineral replacement and a little extra salt seemed to help with the aches. You do need lots of water and must maintain a good fluid intake and I have kept to three brisk half hour walks every week. After trying to lose really stubborn mid life fat for over 10 years, I have never been able to get beyond a stone until now and I'm still losing and will be finishing the first phase by the twelve week mark. Blood sugars back to normal from pre diabetic markers, lipids back to normal, blood pressure the best it's been since my twenties {twas creeping up!} and more energy and fizz, I am very impressed.....one more stone to go and I will be one, very happy bunny!

R23TMA1124FI9,This plan really works!,"I tried Michael Mosely's 8 week Blood Sugar Diet a couple of years ago, to tackle my obesity. It worked very well ,although - like any healthy eating plan - I regained weight when I went back to my old unhealthy habits. So I was keen to try this new, revamped combination of the blood sugar diet and 5:2 diet, incorporating intermittent fasting (time-restricted eating) that is the Fast 800 plan. I am delighted to report that the plan works very effectively, and the rapid weight loss that comes as a result of sticking to the 800 calories is very motivating - I have lost 18 pounds in less than 6 weeks (I have a further 4 stone I would like to lose). I have gone off plan a couple of times, due to indulging at social events, but the weight happily flies off again once I return to plan. I would highly recommend the book, as it feels sustainable for a few months at least (it is recommended you do the 800 calories per day for up to 12 weeks, then switch to the 5:2). As a person who has struggled with overeating and weight gain for many years, this plan helps control my appetite on a daily basis, and has given me hope that I will be able to get to my goal. It contains the most recent scientific research to support it, and the book is an interesting and straightforward read. I've also gone on to buy the Fast 800 recipe book and the Fast Exercise book.

RU1LH8CDA1JQZ,Interesting points but some big niggles,"I did take quite a bit from this, mainly broad encouragement that dieting can work, because frankly for me it hasn’t, not very well (and yes I can count calories thanks). Dr Moseley’s approach will influence what I do from now on. As for the niggles. Well Dr M had a blood sugar problem, so the effect of this approach on blood sugar problems gets a lot of emphasis. Blood pressure barely warrants a mention, though it’s just as big a problem for overweight people. He advocates rapid weight loss but almost in passing tells us of the Matador experiment and the success therein of an on/off approach to dieting. Is this not contradictory? He describes his own experiment with the diet, giving his starting weight and waist measurement but not his height, so no real point of reference for the reader. That’s pedantic, yes, but dieting requires attention to detail. The big irritant though is the recipe section. All the recipes are overly fussy and time-consuming, And you are not going to find those ingredients in a local version of your supermarket. Why not tell us the stuff we can all put our hands on rather than miso, turmeric, cumin and all that middle-class fluff?

Dr Moseley’s approach will influence what I do from now on.<br>As for the niggles. Well Dr M had a blood sugar problem, so the effect of this approach on blood sugar problems gets a lot of emphasis. Blood pressure barely warrants a mention, though it’s just as big a problem for overweight people.<br>He advocates rapid weight loss but almost in passing tells us of the Matador experiment and the success therein of an on/off approach to dieting. Is this not contradictory?<br>He describes his own experiment with the diet, giving his starting weight and waist measurement but not his height, so no real point of reference for the reader. That’s pedantic, yes, but dieting requires attention to detail.<br>The big irritant though is the recipe section. All the recipes are overly fussy and time-consuming, And you are not going to find those ingredients in a local version of your supermarket. Why not tell us the stuff we can all put our hands on rather than miso, turmeric, cumin and all that middle-class fluff? I have canned, yes, don’t gasp with horror, canned, salmon and mackerel, eggs, loads of normal salad stuff and fruit, low-sugar baked beans, almonds, olive oil. What I can I get off the shelf?

R6LO8O4UB66JS,Brilliant,Saw the author on This Morning and thought wow this sounds like it’s worth a try. Glad I bought this. Basically the whole book is about limiting your calories to just 800 a day and eating during a limited time window of say six hours a day and not eating during the other eighteen. So is there a need for a whole book about it? Well some may say no and it’s right when people are talking about all the scientific facts and case studies that appear throughout the book. But this information is important. It’s important to know who’s done this before and how did the diet affect them. It’s essential reading but not for those who can’t absorb facts n figures. I’ve done really well so far and lost half a stone in the first two weeks. It’s hard and my stomach is rumbling like thunder. I had a few headaches in week 1 but I’m over it now. This is definitely a good read and I’m glad I bought it,<span>Saw the author on This Morning and thought wow this sounds like it’s worth a try. Glad I bought this.

R2JA7JUCRKFGFQ,Great recipes for all the family!  Don't hesitate buying this.,"My wife bought this book as she wanted us as a family to cut down (not out) on our sugar intake and she wanted a recipe book that provided some inspiration and a varied menu to achieve this. It's no secret we were consuming far too much sugar so we decided to get proactive before our health began to seriously suffer. The recipes in this book are delicious and even better, they're simple with a minimal number of ingredients required across most of the recipes. As full time working parents anything we can cook that is quick, simple, tasty and healthy every night is a total bonus. Unlike competitors to this book where the ingredients are a-plenty and somewhat pricey, these ingredients are your day to day stuff combined to make delicious flavours and simple meals that the whole family (not just adults) can enjoy. The Pork in Mustard is an absolute fave! The food is filling and if you do your best to stick to the plan you won't be hungry however as our goal was to significantly reduce not remove sugar from our diet we do allow ourselves some sugar free jelly with chopped fresh fruit and a dollop of reduced fat creme fraiche for dessert each night because we found we did want something a little sweet just once a day. Adding this pudding hasn't hindered our progress in any major way and we're finding we can pinch a bit less belly fat already. Really worth having this book open and ready to use and not gathering dust on your shelf. There are loads of recipes to choose from that are inexpensive and simple to make. Tonight we're making meatballs from it and our 8 year old will get involved in the prep of it too so we can educate her on the importance of cooking simple healthy meals. I wished we'd known about the pitfalls of sugar decades ago before we got hooked on it! Nonetheless this is a great recipe book for weaning yourself off sugar without feeling deprived. Highly recommend and for the price it's excellent value for money.","<span>My wife bought this book as she wanted us as a family to cut down (not out) on our sugar intake and she wanted a recipe book that provided some inspiration and a varied menu to achieve this.

R3GAETOP60GROP,Honestly the best Recipe Book I ever bought.,"I am a hoarder of recipe books and I can honestly say this is the best recipe book I have ever bought simply because I've tried a whole host of it's recipes and all have been delicious, not one duff one! I am a bit fussy when it comes to meals I like them to be dead tasty, I don't do bland, so I've often been disappointed with previous recipe books when they promise a delicious recipes which turn out to be bland. Not so with this book, Michael and his GP wife must have my love for tasty food that's easy to prepare and requires no special cookery skills.  I don't have blood sugar problems, I'm not diabetic, but I am over weight and have a hard time trying to lose weight. Although my diet was relatively healthy I was addicted to starchy carbs and I'm sure that was where my weight loss problem was. I bought this together with the Blood Sugar Diet paperback and Micheal Mosley's other wonderful book the Clever Guts Diet and have not looked back. I'm following recipes from both books as they are both based on the same style low carb Mediterranean style diet, I'm not following the 800 calorie a day diet as that's too hard for me but instead I'm just using the recipes in both books for all my meals.  I've lost half a stone in 3 weeks which is a great weight for me, considering I'm not following the 800 calorie rule, I'm not counting calories at all, on previous diets like WW and SW I only used to lose half a pound to a pound a week if I was lucky. Amazingly I don't miss the starchy carbs at all probably because the recipes in the book are so delicious and satisfying. I love how I haven't had to cut out all fat as in previous diets but instead can have plenty of good fats, like olive oil, nuts, seeds, full fat yogurt and cheese.....yum. Like the book warns I did feel a bit hungry in the first few days while my body adapted to burning fats for fuel rather than sugary carbs but that soon passed. I never thought I'd be able to give up bread for lunch, but the alternatives lunches in this book are so much nicer, I wasn't much of a fish eater but this book has converted me.  Recipes tried so far include: Main Meals: Chicken Korma - best homemade curry I've made and already a family favourite, delicious with the Cauliflower Rice recipe in the Clever Guts Book. No Pasta Beef Lasagne - delicious, never thought I'd say it but better than lasagne with pasta and I was a pasta lover. another Family favourite. Creamy Fish Bake - Yummy, didn't like Celeriac before but it's great with this, another family favourite. Lamb Tagine - Lovely, especially if made the day before so flavours develop even more, nice with Quinoa. Pancetta, Broccoli and Tomato Gratin - so simple yet so tasty and surprisingly filling. Seedy Flapjacks - Lovely and perfect if you're in need of a quick snack. StirF-Fried Cabbage and Peppered Mackerel - I could live on this and I never used to liked smoked fish, so simple to make, especially if like me you're lazy and use just cabbage and fish, finely sliced a cabbage (I used a whole pointed cabbage for 2 people), fry in a little olive oil for a few minutes, break up a couple of smoked mackerel fillets and chuck 'em in to heat through, viola tasty filling lunch.  If you like tasty grub and need to lose some weight you can't fail with this book.","<span>I am a hoarder of recipe books and I can honestly say this is the best recipe book I have ever bought simply because I've tried a whole host of it's recipes and all have been delicious, not one duff one!

R1HUOQRRDDJOBA,Could be much better but it has worked,"Bought the print version originally but found the text too small so I then purchased the Kindle edition which is much better. The meal plans in the back of either book have no reference to the page number of the actually recipes and it is often difficult to find the recipes in the index as they often come under different names. The Kindle version wins on this as it is possible to search the text and then bookmark the location or highlight the name of the recipe.  The recipes themselves are quite expensive and. if one follows the meal plans, there will be some wasted food at the end of the week. Be prepared to freeze what you can. Unfortunately, my freezer space is limited so this is not always possible.  Some of the evening meals have been quite tasty such as the Salmon with lemon and dill nut crust with roasted veg, Easy Bolognese, Michael's Thai Fish Cakes, Pork Steaks in Mustard Sauce, Thai Red Curry, Moroccan Meatballs, Baked Fish and Chorizo Parcels and Turkey Burgers etc. but many of the recipes contain quite a lot of chilli which over powers them such as the Chicken Korma (which is supposed to be a milder curry) and Spicy Spinach and Lentil Dahl and, whilst I do like chilli, I do not enjoy every meal just tasting of chilli. I also found the courgetti (spaghetti type) recipes to be unimaginative as are the lunch recipes which are mostly lunch box type of meals such as tuna in lettuce, dips with vegetable sticks, tiny kebabs with a whopping 430 calories (out of the 800 calorie allowance for the day) and just left me hungry. The soups sound better but one is a Tomato, ham and lentil soup which has 440 calories and 40g of carbs. It also contains chilli flakes and I am guessing, as I have not made it, that it will mask all the other flavours. Maybe I just have over developed taste buds.  Edited as now almost at end of the 8 week plan.  I learned to adapt the recipes over the weeks and cut down on some of the spices in some recipes. This made the meals more appropriate for my tastes. The breakfasts and evening meals are, on the whole, very good and I will continue to make some of these once the 8 weeks are up. Blood glucose levels have responded very well in a short time so very happy about this.","<span>Bought the print version originally but found the text too small so I then purchased the Kindle edition which is much better.

R38QJI1APV57ZF,"I still highly recommend this book, read on","In a way I should give this book 5 stars. I do highly recommend it. However the niggles are such a pain, I'm only giving it 1.  The recipes are excellent, I'm following the plan at the back of the book to the letter and there have been some really really yummy recipes  The weight is also falling off, so why am I not giving it 5 stars?  Three main reasons.  1) The 8 week meal plan has no recipe page numbers on it and often calls the names of the recipes something slightly different to the index.  2) While often only by 10 or so calories, sometimes the meal plan and the recipe disagrees about how many calories are in a recipe  3) The index isn't always consistent, making things very hard to find  This might seem trivial, but when I'm trying to follow their meal plan and watch my calorie intake and it's taking forever to find recipes, and when I do, sometimes the calories are different, it kind of makes me wonder what else is wrong.  It's taken me over 3 hours to write the page numbers into the plan. This should have been done before publishing. It also would have taken me about 30 mins if everything was clear in the index etc.  Some examples. The plan says ""No-Pasta Lasagna"" so I look under ""L"" and ""N"". It's actually a sub section of ""Beef""  Plan says ""Kipper and Tomatoes"" This is correctly indexed under both ""K"" and under the subsection of ""Fish"". So when a fish recipe comes up, I simply go to the fish heading and quickly find it. That's unless I want the recipe for ""Tuna Patties"", that's only under ""T"" and not under ""Fish""  The plan says ""Avocado and Feta Wrap"". The index has it as ""Avocado and Feta Bash"". Sure when you go to the page it makes sense that it is a wrap, and on it's own this may be trivial, but it's been a real headache finding some of the recipes.  The plan says ""Tzatziki with 2 seeded thin crackers = 200 calories"" The recipe for ""Tzatziki"" is 140 calories, the recipe for the ""seeded crackers"" are 50 calories EACH, meaning it equals 250 calories not 200.  The plan says ""Spanish chicken with chorizo = 540 calories"", the recipe says it's only 495 calories  There are a fair few where there's 10 calories different.  This all might sound a little trivial, but when I'm trying to count calories, it kind of dents my faith a little  They list salads such as ""Greek Salad = 250 calories"", ""Rainbow salad = 120 calories"", ""Broccoli and Asparagus salad = 60 calories""  The Plan says ""Chili salad = 160 calories"", with ""Rocket and tomato salad = 60 calories""  There's no rocket salad in the book. OK some might argue, use your common sense, get a few rocket leaves, chop up a tomato and there you go, but that's not the point, I'm trying to follow this diet to the letter, I want to know my salad is only 60 calories and not say 120.  I still very very very highly recommend this book, the meals are fabulous and it works, but such a great book is tarnished by the above, especially the lack of recipe page numbers on the meal plan.  If the above was fixed I'd have given it five stars, but it's such a pain, it only warrants one","<span>In a way I should give this book 5 stars. I do highly recommend it.

RPCV41YMB5XRJ,It could be so much better,"It is not that it is a bad book but it really, really could be so much better with only a little effort.  My wife and I are using it in conjunction with ""The 8 week Blood Sugar Diet"" book by Dr Michael Mosley, to which this is a companion, and we are trying to work steadily through the laid out 4 week plan in the latter. It does not take long to find that there are recipes that we do not like. No surprise that, given that for us, and many other people I imagine, it is a fairly radical change in eating habits. This is where it lets you down. My pet hate is the monster mushrooms that it uses as the base (like a slab of toast) for several of its recipes. No problem I thought, lets substitute something else, like a slab of beef tomato as a base. Is there a table whereby I can look up the calories for tomato, compared to mushrooms ? NOPE. No matter maybe I can substitute a completely different recipe with more or less the same total calories. Is there an index of recipes by total calories ? NOPE. OK so I will just have to flog through the recipe book and find one the hard way. OK I did not expect it to be that HARD. Remember this whole exercise is about CALORIES and sure enough they are given for each recipe BUT in minutely small print (4 point ? Whatever it is it makes the small print in a legal contract look large.) And if that is not enough to make it illegible, just to make sure that it is, it is printed in light grey type on a white background.  So provided your happy with the recipes and don't want to change anything, or you have a large magnifying glass and plenty of time, you will be fine. And I am pleased to say that they do actually work: I am losing weight fairly rapidly, unlike any previous diet I have tried, and next week I will know how I am doing on the blood sugar level, having been to have a blood test this morning.  THE PUBLSHERS ""SHORT BOOKS"" have, true to name, fallen SHORT, IMHO.","<span>It is not that it is a bad book but it really, really could be so much better with only a little effort.<br><br>My wife and I are using it in conjunction with ""The 8 week Blood Sugar Diet"" book by Dr Michael Mosley, to which this is a companion, and we are trying to work steadily through the laid out 4 week plan in the latter.

Even my partner loves it.  I bought this book along with the fast 800 recipe book (which I haven't started yet) because I follow the 5/2 diet to keep my weight down and having researched all the books wanted the ones written by his wife. This really does not disappoint at all. I am not aware I if I have a blood sugar problem but just wanted to eat healthily and retrain my cooking habits. I love vegetarian food aswell and there is plenty of variety of that in this book too. I highly recommend this book to ANYONE - either to lose weight, add variety to your cooking, eat healthily or simply reduce sugar intake. A total inspiration. LOVE IT !!!

The recipes however look interesting and the plan varied. The book itself is a good quality and I like that there are quite a few pictures of the finished dishes.

R4Y6QATHBHAGP,Not a cheap way to diet,"I’ve also written a review of the diet book. If you’re not really interested in the background to the diet you could just buy this book as it has a summary and lots more recipes than the other book. There are some really good recipes in here, practical advice and particularly liked the quick supper choices. It is not cheap to follow this as it’s so heavy on meat/fish so we are spending £20-30 a week extra on food at the moment. 6% body weight loss (5&7kg) after seven weeks, so not as dramatic as the weight loss by using diet ‘shakes’ but better for you as it’s more sustainable to learn new low carb recipes. Some recipes seem a bit light on the herbs/spices and if you’re not a fairly decent cook it might be difficult to follow. Food waste was a challenge in the first couple of weeks as a lot of recipes get you to use half a pack/jar of something and then the ingredient doesn’t appear in anything else in the book. If you follow the weekly planner in the diet book this happens a lot so you will need to mix it up a bit.","<span>I’ve also written a review of the diet book.

R3THG0Y6HUQPSJ,"Great book, lovely recipes","I love this book, it focuses on flavours, and easy to follow recipes, all but one I have enjoyed. It teaches you that not having a diet high in carbs can control your weight and used as a weight loss aid, can actually reverse type 2 diabetes.  2 things that really annoy me. 1 the actual 8 week diet is at the end. For every meal you need to a) look up the recipe, then 2 write down all the ingredients that you will need.  This is a bit of a time consuming exercise for weeks one and two, when you haven't got half the ingredients in your store cupboard, but by the time you are at week three, you are able to write down what you require quickly and easily.  I am on week 5, I lost 6 pounds in the first week, 2 in week 2 and 1.5 pound per week for weeks 3 and 4. Total weight-loss going in to week 5 is 11 pounds.  This book works, if you stick to the rules. (there are ""healthy"" snacks in there which you can have, I particularly love the flapjacks).  The recipes are well structured, and easy to follow. I needed to buy a spiraliser, but most supermarkets now sell spiralised vegetables.  There is some wastage of food however (perhaps an improvement for next version!), and the recipes go from serves 6 to serves 2, which can be annoying, but overall I am pleased that it has delivered what it said it would.","<span>I love this book, it focuses on flavours, and easy to follow recipes, all but one I have enjoyed.

RW39VP8WEZIY4,The best recipe book I have ever bought,"We're on a low carb diet to lose weight and I had been strugggling to find suitable recipes for tasty dishes using ingredients that I recognised and could buy locally. I am so glad that I happened upon this one - it is fantastic! It has been especially useful during lockdown, when we have been able to plan our menus for the week, make a comprehensive list of what we need to buy, and look forward to our evening meal each day. We have started to be more adventurous in trying out new recipes as well as thoroughly enjoying familiar meals such as chicken and musroom pie (cabbage leaves instead of pastry), pork steaks in mustard sauce, and fish bake using celeriac or cauliflower mash instead of potato for the topping. The calorie and carbohydrate content is given for each recipe, and in four months we have steadily lost more than two stone between us, about half of our long-term target. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Thank you Drs Clare Bailey and Sarah Schenker!","<span>We're on a low carb diet to lose weight and I had been strugggling to find suitable recipes for tasty dishes using ingredients that I recognised and could buy locally.

RQTV2KLLPAH2D,Brilliantly researched exposé of the link between food additives and obesity,"Why is there an obesity epidemic in the west and why are populations becoming more unhealthy? Why are “ethnic” foods healthy, and why do remote peoples become unhealthy when exposed to western diets? This book sets out to explain why in an easy to understand and engaging way.  The author explains that the obesity crisis has not been caused by the “usual suspects” of salt, sugar, fat, lack of exercise and abundant, delicious food. It’s not even about sugar and carbs, which I must admit is something that I myself have bought into in the past.  Instead, it’s all about Ultra Processed Food (UPF) – so what is that? There isn’t a short, slick definition, but broadly, if the food is packaged, branded, heavily marketed and crucially, contains more than five ingredients then it is probably UPF. The types of ingredients to watch out for are, for example, modified starches, gums, E numbers, flavour enhancers and emulsifiers etc. In fact there are approximately 2000 such ingredients allowed in the EU but the number in the US is over 10,000. No one knows the true figure because there are no realistic restrictions on what food makers can do and no centralised registration system.  The author describes in some detail Kevin Hall’s experiment (Cellular Metabolism 2019; 30:67-77). This was done under strict laboratory conditions whereby a sample group of people were fed two diets containing exactly matched quantities of sugar, carbs, protein and fibre etc. The only difference was that one group was given food with these additives and the other not. After a few days, the group with additives were eating 500 calories more per person per day. In fact the other group members started losing weight. This experiment has been widely quoted in scientific literature – but it hasn’t really entered the mainstream.  Another eye-popping study was conducted by Herman Pontzer (Energy Expenditure and adiposity in Nigerian and African American women. Obesity 2008; 16: 2148-54). The results were so counter-intuitive that they ran the test several times. The study proved that office workers in the US burn as many calories every day as hunter gathers in Africa. Everyone burns about the same number of calories a day whether they are couch potatoes or have active lifestyles. And there are good evolutionary reasons for this. So if you want to lose weight, going to the gym every night won’t help – it all comes down to diet, and specifically, the quantity of factory produced additives that you put in your mouth every day.  How did we westerners arrive at this situation? It's the logical end point of having global food companies compete with each other to maximise sales and minimise costs without regard to the long term health costs which is the (inevitable) by-product. It is an example of a market failure, except the author is not an economist but a scientist, so this is my personal summary of the point. This also leads to deforestation, global warming and climate change which is not a direct theme of the book, but which is mentioned a few times.  But the author is quite clear about the solution to the problem and this is endorsed by food industry insiders – there has to be government regulation. This point leads to another thesis of the book: Food companies are massive global companies with multi-billion pound market capitalisations – it is in their interests to protect this wealth and they do this in many ways, not all of which are strictly honest.  For example, there are many examples in the pharmaceutical sector of industry funded research which offers skewed results. The food sector is no different. Worse still, the author gives specific examples of “independent” studies where the authors state they are independent, but have actually been funded by food industry sources.  Food companies also have massive political clout with lobbying. In the EU, a large chunk of the budget of one of the food safety ministries comes from industry sources. The author states several times that the relationship between “big food” and government should be confrontational and antagonistic – not cosy and friendly like how things currently are.  There is a section at the end of the book about formula milk for babies – the takeaway being that you should breast-feed your babies for as long as possible and avoid formula, particularly if you are a poor, illiterate peasant living in an area with low quality water.  Even though this is not sold as a weight loss book, I think this is the most influential diet, weight loss book I have ever read. It has had a profound effect on me since I finished reading it a few days ago. I found myself rushing home from work in order to continue reading – it is that full of interesting information. This book should be read by healthcare professionals, politicians, economists, climate activists and anyone who wants to live healthily and lose weight.","<span>Why is there an obesity epidemic in the west and why are populations becoming more unhealthy?

R206X643BG6WOC,Controversial and very well written,"I had seen this book everywhere. It’s pretty distinctive with its bright yellow cover, controversial title and huge publicity campaign. I wasn’t sure if this was going to be a good book (I had never read any Rebecca F. Kuang work before) or whether it was all just hype but I grabbed a Kindle copy on the Amazon Black Friday sale for 99p.  The main character is June Hayward. June is a struggling author, her only book had a mediocre reception, and she cannot seem to find that next big story that will see her gain the adoration she feels she deserves. June is best friends with fellow author Athena Liu. Athena’s books are much more successful and June is jealous and feels like she’s living in Athena’s shadow. When Athena dies, June is left in possession of the only copy of Athena's very final and very brilliant manuscript. No one has previously read this manuscript so the temptation for June to pass this off as her own work is strong.  I did no research before starting this book so I didn’t realise how it has split reviewers. It does seem that you either love or hate this book. I have to say that I really enjoyed it. June is a great character; she is jealous, racist, petty, scared, strong, confident and miserable and we get to follow her entertaining downward spiral. I watched with horror at some of the things she did or said, she was like a horrific event that I couldn’t look away from. I also really enjoyed the other characters in the book, they all had their role to play and usually with their own motives.  Although I don’t usually like books about books, I thought the storyline was original and interesting and I actually enjoyed learning a bit more about the publishing industry. There are so many themes in this book, some obvious and some less so and Kuang makes us sit with our discomfort through an excellent choice of an unreliable narrator and forces us to confront our own opinions on the matters.  This book moves at a slow pace as the characters and the central thread of the story is established so if you come expecting big thrills and high stakes tension, you'll be disappointed but I appreciated the approach. I did predict the ending but this didn’t take any enjoyment away from the book for me. I didn’t know how I should feel about June at any given time and this kept me on my toes and kept me thinking about the book and its themes when I wasn’t reading it.

RO8HOISKGV6YT,Scarily plausible - are you sure you want to be a writer?,"I can see why this has been a book that has divided readers. I think, if you work in or around the publishing industry, you will appreciate some elements of the story more than this who remain blissfully unaware on the outside of all that goes on. Then again, if you pay even the remotest bit of attention to what goes on in the sordid world of social media then you can perhaps understand many elements of this story. After all there have been many careers made, and ruined, at the hands of social media keyboard warriors, and so many aspects of this story, so many of the key themes, are fresh, current and, for some, still very raw. You don't need to be in publishing to recognise dogpiling when you see it, or to understand the negative side of 'fame'. Or maybe, in this case, infamy.  For me, kind of on the outside as a reader, but not entirely, I really enjoyed this book. Understood some of what the author was portraying, laughed along in all the right (wrong) places, became infuriated in the right ones too, and recognised this story for what it is. A warts an all portrayal of an industry that is far more complex, and cut throat, than many people might realise. Exaggerated for effect? Possibly. But behind every exaggeration is a seed of truth. For most authors, who don't have legacy backlist and a longstanding reputation and fan base to hang their hat on, you live and die by your last sales total, dropped from the schedule the moment your figures don't meet expectations, or when there is a hint of a scandal that, even by the best spin doctor, cannot be exploited for commercial gain. And that, for most, is a very hard place to exist.  This is the story of June Hayward, and author whose only title had a mediocre reception at best, and who is struggling to find that next big story that will see her gain the adoration she feels she deserves. She is best friends with Athena Liu whose fortunes have proven far greater than June's. When a very unfortunate foodie incident (yes really) sees Athena meet a premature end, June is left with a dilemma. She has in her possession the only copy of Athena's very final manuscript. Will she do the right thing and hand it over to Athena's estate? Or will she take advantage of the fact that no-one else knows about the book, and use it to further her own career? Now, if she did the right thing, this would be a very short book. In fairness to her, she does rewrite huge elements of the text, but the core -the inspiration, the tone, the story - still belongs to Athena. When her agent, and a prominent Indie publisher, snap up the book, it's too late to turn back, and what follows is a mixture of karma, pride, arrogance and revenge, a sorry tale that escalates beyond anything June could ever have foreseen.  The opening of this book is slower in pace as the characters and the central thread of the story is established. If you come expecting big thrills and high stakes tension, you'll be bitterly disappointed. If anything the book initially mirrors the slow and painstaking process of creating that perfect story to begin with. The story is told from June's perspective, so from the outset we get a very skewed view of events, everything geared towards her own justification for her actions and that mental back and forth between the rights and wrongs of her decisions really has an alarming feeling of authenticity. A moral dilemma indeed, but the promise, and presence, of a healthy advance soon provides a balm to sooth June's conscience. I can't say I liked June - I didn't much like any of the characters to be honest with you, other than probably Athena's mother. But it's not important for this book to succeed that we like any of them. In fact, it feels almost the direct opposite is true.  The story that June 'enhances' is one that Athena was ethically well placed to write, one to which June has little to no connection - the story of Chinese labourers used for the war effort. It opens up discussion and consideration, not only in the book but on a wider scales, about cultural appropriation. Is it okay for a white American woman to write a book about Chinese immigrants as long as the portrayal is sympathetic and authentic, or is it simply exploitation and something that Chinese-American readers can feel rightfully outraged about. Of course, June, and her publisher, would argue the former, but the use of an ethnically ambiguous name somewhat muddies the waters, allowing readers to make assumptions about the author that may not be true. And there are other elements that June allows to happen that start to create conflict in an already contentious situation. Plagiarism, or manuscript theft, aside, This is a very complex situation, not helped by June's defensiveness, something else that creates a rift that may yet prove to be her undoing.  So many elements of this book - the cultural appropriation argument is just a drop in the ocean - ring true. The dogpiling on social media, the needs of certain characters to rip apart June for nothing more than their own smug satisfaction, felt almost uncomfortably true to life. I've seen it myself - active campaigns against a particular author or celebrity because they shared an opinion that differs from someone else's. There is, at the end of the day, no defending June's initial actions, but there is no defending the campaign against her either. The author's exploration of the impact of social media on mental health, that constant nagging need to see what is being said about you despite knowing that it will not be good for your soul, is so en-pointe that I'm sure for many author's it will cut to the bone. If the 'antagonist' (and there is a very loosely defined antagonist in this book) could claim their actions are coming entirely from the moral high ground then I might have felt more sympathy for them. But they weren't and I didn't. They acted in a way as indefensible as June. In fact, I kind of despised them a little. More than a little. Quite a lot actually.  There is a comedic element to this story too, and for anyone in the know you will find yourself smiling a grudging smile. References to an author's nemesis ""GoodReads"" made me chuckle. It does have a reputation as being a cesspit for reviewers who have no filter and who delight in slamming books for nothing more than their satisfaction. It's a site where you can even leave a one star review for a book that isn't even available in proof form, which some folks seem to delight in doing. I know - call me a hypocrite - I post there too, but largely as a way to counter the negativity with a little bit of light. But, debates about review sites aside, there are many other moments which made me smile. Many folks would be forgiven for thinking that authors are loaded, living the dream on yacht's and in luxury apartments around the globe. The height of June's ambition from spending her royalties is being able to afford an Ikea sofa to match the rest of her recently acquired Ikea furniture. I'm saying nothing more ...  Funny yet sometimes dark, this is a fresh, beautifully written foray into the mind of a very troubled, young, author. I really enjoyed this book. I can see why many authors enjoyed this too. Maybe it is a little bit conflated, with tongue in cheek exaggeration, but there is so much of this book that feels scarily authentic that there's a danger Rebecca Kuang will have people thinking twice about pursuing a career as an author. Or maybe that was the point. After all, less competition can only be a good things for sales, right?","<span>I can see why this has been a book that has divided readers. I think, if you work in or around the publishing industry, you will appreciate some elements of the story more than this who remain blissfully unaware on the outside of all that goes on. Then again, if you pay even the remotest bit of attention to what goes on in the sordid world of social media then you can perhaps understand many elements of this story. After all there have been many careers made, and ruined, at the hands of social media keyboard warriors, and so many aspects of this story, so many of the key themes, are fresh, current and, for some, still very raw. You don't need to be in publishing to recognise dogpiling when you see it, or to understand the negative side of 'fame'. Or maybe, in this case, infamy.<br><br>For me, kind of on the outside as a reader, but not entirely, I really enjoyed this book. Understood some of what the author was portraying, laughed along in all the right (wrong) places, became infuriated in the right ones too, and recognised this story for what it is. A warts an all portrayal of an industry that is far more complex, and cut throat, than many people might realise. Exaggerated for effect? Possibly. But behind every exaggeration is a seed of truth. For most authors, who don't have legacy backlist and a longstanding reputation and fan base to hang their hat on, you live and die by your last sales total, dropped from the schedule the moment your figures don't meet expectations, or when there is a hint of a scandal that, even by the best spin doctor, cannot be exploited for commercial gain. And that, for most, is a very hard place to exist.<br><br>This is the story of June Hayward, and author whose only title had a mediocre reception at best, and who is struggling to find that next big story that will see her gain the adoration she feels she deserves. She is best friends with Athena Liu whose fortunes have proven far greater than June's. When a very unfortunate foodie incident (yes really) sees Athena meet a premature end, June is left with a dilemma. She has in her possession the only copy of Athena's very final manuscript. Will she do the right thing and hand it over to Athena's estate? Or will she take advantage of the fact that no-one else knows about the book, and use it to further her own career? Now, if she did the right thing, this would be a very short book. In fairness to her, she does rewrite huge elements of the text, but the core -the inspiration, the tone, the story - still belongs to Athena. When her agent, and a prominent Indie publisher, snap up the book, it's too late to turn back, and what follows is a mixture of karma, pride, arrogance and revenge, a sorry tale that escalates beyond anything June could ever have foreseen.<br><br>The opening of this book is slower in pace as the characters and the central thread of the story is established. If you come expecting big thrills and high stakes tension, you'll be bitterly disappointed. If anything the book initially mirrors the slow and painstaking process of creating that perfect story to begin with. The story is told from June's perspective, so from the outset we get a very skewed view of events, everything geared towards her own justification for her actions and that mental back and forth between the rights and wrongs of her decisions really has an alarming feeling of authenticity. A moral dilemma indeed, but the promise, and presence, of a healthy advance soon provides a balm to sooth June's conscience. I can't say I liked June - I didn't much like any of the characters to be honest with you, other than probably Athena's mother. But it's not important for this book to succeed that we like any of them. In fact, it feels almost the direct opposite is true.<br><br>The story that June 'enhances' is one that Athena was ethically well placed to write, one to which June has little to no connection - the story of Chinese labourers used for the war effort.

R3KNU8BUE0MA8M,More satirical literary than thriller,"What to make of this book? I honestly don't know! I liked the plot: 2 authors, 1 highly successful star of the moment Athena (Asian American yes its important to know), the other unsuccessful with a failed debut novel Juniper (white American). They are supposedly friends, however June is highly jealous of Athena. One night whilst having been drinking celebrating Athena's latest success, June witnesses Athena's death by choking having been unable to help. Now moments before her death, the secretive Athena had showed June her newest and completed 1st draft of her latest book. She says no one else has seen or heard about it, so June steals it in the proceeding commotion of Athena's death and subsequently publishes it as her own work to much success. The book is a historical WW1 fiction piece about Chinese labourers and as June is a white woman, a lot of criticism is thrown at her for it. What ensues is a racial satire about the publishing world and social media influence.  The book is marketed as a thriller? It is hardly a thriller more a satirical literary piece with a tiny thriller element towards the end. The book was somewhat slow paced the majority of the time focusing too much on the negative aspects of social media and highlighting racism and reverse racism, mental health connected to bullying and the negative aspects of publishing which were interesting to learn about.  The beginning was good setting up the plot, the middle dragged on and on more or less repeating itself in slightly vsrying ways and the ending fell a bit flat for me. I wanted more, it almost just stopped. I enjoyed it but could not give the 5 stars due to pacing, not being what it was marketed as and I felt the message was a bit confusing perhaps even contradictory? Perhaps I just don't 'get it' which is fine too.","<span>What to make of this book?<br>I honestly don't know!<br>I liked the plot:<br>2 authors, 1 highly successful star of the moment Athena (Asian American yes its important to know), the other unsuccessful with a failed debut novel Juniper (white American).

RODVI6IQ5BJ89,Ingenue or Enfant Terrible?,"This is a writer’s novel in every sense of the word. It examines the issues of racism and cultural appropriation in literary writing, the attraction of cancel culture on social media, the volatile allure of celebrity authors and the ugly cutthroat world of publishing.  But R.F. Huang’s novel does all these things and much, much more. In a metafictive way, Huang deploys her identity as an Asian American author and assumes the persona of a white young writer Juniper Song Hayward who finds herself with her dead Asian writer friend’s unpublished manuscript about Chinese immigrants in World War 1.  By taking on the first-person perspective of a white young writer who finds herself in a literary maelstrom amid accusations of plagiarism and appropriation of her dead friend’s work and Asian voices (e.g. who has the right to write about someone else’s suffering, even if it is fiction?), Huang heads off criticism of reverse racism (also something she explores through Juniper’s own experiences), problematises the readers’ perspectives and sides they should take as she stands these issues on their heads.  Huang’s anti-heroine Juniper is an unreliable and morally ambivalent character which complicates the readers’ empathy for her. Athena Liu, the doe-eyed and pretty ingenue of the literary scene that is Juniper’s supposed close friend and from whom she (steals/borrows?) her manuscript (is it really stealing if it is sketchy and unpolished?) after Athena accidentally chokes on some midnight pancakes, arguably shares a more similar background with the author, but that Huang chooses to write from Juniper’s story is quite an ingenious sleight of hand.  The pace of the novel is unrelenting and Huang’s fine prose (aside from her overuse of words and phrases such as “melatonin” and “dry heaving”) engages effortlessly, and the reader is both hopeful and afraid that the truth will surface and destroy Juniper.","<span>This is a writer’s novel in every sense of the word.

R1DL5QJ0SUAYLF,Wow!,"A really gripping read - particularly impressive as I disliked the main character, Juniper, from the beginning and she just got worse! This was an extraordinarily biting and wicked exposition of the publishing world - not an area I've ever felt strongly about so, again, it was so clever to make it suddenly really interesting! This book made me want to seriously consider what I buy in the future - am I being manipulated by the hype? Am I being dragged into whatever the publishers think will sell to the masses? I do hope I'm a more discerning reader than that but who knows? The racist issue was used cleverly, reminding me how it can be used in so many different ways to drive different agendas - not always those that help the people who actually suffer from it. As an elderly reader of many thousands of books, I've encountered lots of stuff about online trolling and it always fascinates and horrifies me. Here, it did the same and as a driving force behind some of June's quite weird behaviour it worked well. As a dire warning never to go anywhwere near any of the scary social platforms, it worked brilliantly! As a reminder that internet fame and infamy blooms and shrivels without ever touching reality it was also brilliant. Overall, I thought this was a really good novel.

R11WYKN0I3IKGJ,Review,"I've heard a lot about Yellowface over the last year or so, so I was very keen to see what it is all about. I can see why it's been on social media a lot, as it raises a lot of questions about not just the publishing industry, but our lives in general, particularly in terms of our attitudes to racism and diversity.  The premise of the novel is set up fairly early, and it was fairly easy for me to see, at least in general terms, where the plot was going. However, this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it - quite the opposite - as I got to know each of the characters. The novel is written in first person from June's perspective, and it's clear almost immediately that she's insecure and jealous. Her perspective was almost uncomfortable, yet so compelling and it was difficult to stop reading. I wasn't sure if I should feel angry towards her or sorry for her, but it's these kind of moral questions that make Yellowface a really interesting story.  I'm always rubbish at guessing the end of books, so it will come as no surprise to anyone that I didn't guess this one. However, the ending does have a much more tense feel than the rest of the story and I enjoyed reading as this played out. The ending isn't neatly tied together and I will be thinking about the future for the characters after I finish reading.","<span>I've heard a lot about Yellowface over the last year or so, so I was very keen to see what it is all about.

It was a little tiresome at times. It probably held a mirror up to me that I didn’t enjoy- but I am not sure if that is what I particularly want from a book. I read to escape from my uncomfortable feelings and I think that this book gave me a few more. Although the narrator is not a very likeable character, I identified with a lot of the emotions that she felt and being slightly embarrassed and ashamed to be white. In that sense- I suppose it is a literary triumph but an uncomfortable read.

Thirdly, an interesting inside look at the book publishing process which was so interesting.

June is an aspiring writer who has struggled to make the kind of splash that she wanted. Her debut was only slightly successful and her agent doesn't really engage with her much at all. Meanwhile, who sometimes friend from college, Athena, is hugely successful. Athena's first novel was wildly successful, winning awards left, right and centre.

However, during one of their semi regular meet ups they end up back at Athena's apartment where Athena chokes to death on pancakes.  Suddenly June becomes semi famous, and this is built on when she publishers Athena's unseen manuscript about Chinese labourers during World War One as her own work. Now June is stratospherically famous....but she is being plagued by accusations of cultural insensitivity, specially as the book is published under her given name and middle name: Juniper Song. Soon the twitter messages turn aggressive and threatening and before long June is jumping at shadows....or is she?  I didn't know what to expect from this book. I'd heard a lot of buzz around it on Instagram and Twitter but didn't really have any expectations as to what the book would be like - I didn't even know what it was about. I didn't like the character of June at all - she comes off as whiny, jealous and entitled and this is something that sticks around right through the novel.

In a cosmically ironic incident, Athena fatally chokes in front of June, seconds after revealing a disgruntled June, her latest manuscript.

R1Z4H3VYPVLP6O,On cultural appropration or revolutionary revisionist review of the publishing industry?,"I read this having completely forgotten I'd fairly recently also read Babel by the same author. The latter book has a very very clever metaphor for colonisation through the lens of magic wrought be a steampunk victorian empire exploiting translation and translaters and the power of words. And a great plot & character.  This novel is less fantasy and more rooted in the real world of celebrity books and their writers, but pivots off of appropriation, literal and figurative, actual and cultural. It would be a spoiler to say exactly how, but the layers of guilt (who is enitled to write a book set in a certain time about a certain people, and who might not be) and authenticity (its fiction, doh!), but also friendships (genuine, or explotative). Very clever stuff (like Babel). On the other hand the author, like one of the protagonists, both is and isn't from the same milieu as the key character in this story either, so (and if this is true, I'm on same side) we assume that the writer believes that the creative process is of course about inhabiting other people's minds, and capturing that for us, the readers, and that journey can be to foreign places and times, otherwise we'd all just be telling stories about ourselves, and that's why social media is largely so banal, since that's what 90% of scribblings there amount to.  I'm reminded of a recent story about a K-pop band who got some flak as none of the women singers was Korean. I'm just gonna say that pop music's greatest exponents are people like Abba and Kylie Minogue, so if you're gonna say you have to be australian or swedish to sing pop music, you are going to look pretty silly.  Anyhow, the most interesting musing in Yellowface, for me, is right near the end when the idea of tearing down the whole publishng industry and replacing it with something more equitable and less predatory appears, sadly too briefly - what that alternative might be would be really interesting to hear more about.  Meanwhile, while there is a very superficial resemblance to The Plot here (which I massively recommend), I really liked this - but here's a thought experiment: What if Juniper Song Hayward was (say) Latina or African American? How would that change your sympathies?","<span>I read this having completely forgotten I'd fairly recently also read Babel by the same author.

R3W0FRCV6F856D,Publishing and its quirks,"I loved learning more about the publishing industry from this book. From acquisitions to promotions and sales, discussions about cultural authenticity and intellectual property.  Juniper Hayward (June Song) is a white author whose ‘friend’ Athena has a much more successful writing career than she does. An incident leads to Juniper stealing her friend’s manuscript and the whole story begins.  A character has never had me so conflicted, one minute I hate her and think she is a thieving racist and other times I found myself understanding (ish) her motives.  Being written in first person, it gives the reader access into the mind of the protagonist.  This book is fast paced, you will find yourself turning the page to see what happens next. I didn’t get dark humour or thriller as advertised but I didn’t miss it.  I think this would be a great bookclub pick because there is so much to discuss.

R3EPD8F22XZZE0,Some good and some flawed recipes,"I was attracted to this book because I needed to lose a bit of weight after Christmas and I am also a Type 2 Diabetic so the low carb recipes were just what I was after. Also the title suggested that the recipes do not need a high degree of culinary skill. My wife and I have been using the recipes for about 2 months now and have found them to be effective in reducing my blood sugar levels after meals and to reduce my weight by about 4 kg from 77.5 kg, which is slower than I hoped.  However, we have a number of issues with the recipes as follows. We have found that we liked less than half the recipes tried, which were mostly those for evening meals. Nearly all the recipes take at least twice as long to prepare as stated. Some recipes were only successful after we modified them to reduce the amount of water, i.e. they came out too watery if the recipe was followed exactly. Also the recipes require a lot more fresh food than we are used to, such that we really need a bigger fridge. Finally many of the breakfast or lunch recipes take too long to prepare, especially if you have to get up early for work. Also most of the lunch recipes are only suitable for preparation at home, which is no good for work, and who wants to spend 30 minutes preparing a light lunch anyway.  To end on a positive note some of the recipes are truly delicious in their own right, e.g. the mackerel fish cakes, egg curry.","<span>I was attracted to this book because I needed to lose a bit of weight after Christmas and I am also a Type 2 Diabetic so the low carb recipes were just what I was after.

R1I95MY6KUZXD1,Changed my body and my life,"This and the other Recipe Book literally changed my life. After 25 years of hating my body, and therefore, wrongly, myself, I eventually decided 'For Once and For All!' when the Lockdown Lard started nearing 15 stone. Yes, you need some willpower, but not much if you *actually* want it and it's therefore your number one priority. You've got to actually want to lose weight and improve your health. Not half-heartedly because you know you should. Small amount of willpower, a week or so of adjustment (again, you're prepared to put up with it because of the main goal you actually want), but actual meals to look forward to. Yes, probably smaller than you would have otherwise, and no, you can't have carbs, but they're still yummy and filling. I really don't miss carbs, I just have more veg now which is lovely. You have how many stones/kilos of energy (fat) hanging off you to use, you don't need to be eating more lol. Enough cooking to make it enjoyable and make you play an active part in changing your life and mindset, but both books easy enough that they can be done mid-week when you're tired after work. Everything is very straightforward, including explaining the science and reasoning behind what you're doing in the introduction - ketosis etc. I wish I'd done this years ago, but the science behind intermittent fasting hadn't happened, and that's all this is but every day, for a period, except only two a week, as I've also done for a few years now. Best thing ever. Never looking back now. Don't need to. I can do this for the rest of my life.","<span>This and the other Recipe Book literally changed my life.

Yes, you need some willpower, but not much if you *actually* want it and it's therefore your number one priority. You've got to actually want to lose weight and improve your health. Not half-heartedly because you know you should. Small amount of willpower, a week or so of adjustment (again, you're prepared to put up with it because of the main goal you actually want), but actual meals to look forward to. Yes, probably smaller than you would have otherwise, and no, you can't have carbs, but they're still yummy and filling. I really don't miss carbs, I just have more veg now which is lovely. You have how many stones/kilos of energy (fat) hanging off you to use, you don't need to be eating more lol. Enough cooking to make it enjoyable and make you play an active part in changing your life and mindset, but both books easy enough that they can be done mid-week when you're tired after work. Everything is very straightforward, including explaining the science and reasoning behind what you're doing in the introduction - ketosis etc. I wish I'd done this years ago, but the science behind intermittent fasting hadn't happened, and that's all this is but every day, for a period, except only two a week, as I've also done for a few years now. Best thing ever. Never looking back now. Don't need to. I can do this for the rest of my life.</span>",5,False,True,gb,False,7,2,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 June 2021,2021-06-09T00:00:00.000Z,pinkwatanabe,,27.0,1780724500,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R1I95MY6KUZXD1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1780724500,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHWY3GZNWWFCHGYOEOGJXOTB5BQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AHHWY3GZNWWFCHGYOEOGJXOTB5BQ,,,
RZCD8B0L6FAI,Really tasty and works very quickly,"I’ve added a picture of my lunch v the picture in the book. I only made 1 portion and didn’t cut mine too neatly as I cut in half to test and put it back in the oven but you can see you get nice portions.  I’ve been using this book for the fast 800 Keto diet so I’m counting up the carbs and protein which is easy.  I’ve been doing the diet for 3 days now and I’ve already lost 5lb. I’ve bought the Keto sticks and those show it’s working well they’ve been getting darker each day.  I prepared myself for a week before I started so I could make sure I knew what I was doing and get the right things for the recipes. I was looking forward to starting and now I have I wish I’d done it sooner.  The food is delicious and very filling too. Ive not had any tummy rumbles so it’s not hard to resist eating other things.  I can see this working long term as I will like to eat this food after I’ve finished, there will be no wondering what to do when I achieve my goal.  Update 17 October 2022 I’m having a break at the moment but I managed to loose 3 stone over 12 weeks. I’m going to have another go to loose the last weight before Christmas. Really pleased with this book.","<span>I’ve added a picture of my lunch v the picture in the book.

RNCFLS2JA921Y,A Must if you are on the Fast 800 diet.,"The trouble with being on a restrictive diet is that you can easily run out of ideas for meals. I have the red book (the first Fast800 recipe book) but I was getting a little bored with those, so this was very welcome. A lot of the recipes are variations on or similar to other recipes in the diet book or previous recipe book, but there are some new ideas which I think make it worth purchasing to add variety to your diet plan. These dishes are also very popular with non-dieters - but they can have things like potatoes!  The Garden Chicken Casserole, Cardamom Chicken, Simple Beef Casserole and Simple Fish Stew are probably my favourites. Some things are so simple, they don't really need a recipe (Simple roasted veg) but they give you menu ideas.  A tip from me though, nearly all the casserole type dishes both in this book and the previous one tell you to add water. If you don't like your casseroles thin and watery, play it by taste - only add water as needed because everyone complains about them being too watery, and they either end up having to thicken it with flour, or reduce it through simmering without lid.","<span>The trouble with being on a restrictive diet is that you can easily run out of ideas for meals.

They’re great ideas of combinations of ingredients that make up a nice interesting meal which really helps me stay inspired and looking forward to meal times.

My favourites are the lamb moussakas and the prawn chilli and lemon spaghetti but I can happily flick through this book and easily plan a week of meals.

RPT0BJDB615A2,An excellent addition to the 'Fasting' Library.,"I will start by saying that I have been Intermittent Fasting for some time, initially with the 5:2 plan and then following the refinements in the Fast 800. This approach to eating has quite simply changed my life.  'The Fast 800 Easy' starts with an introduction by Dr Michael Mosley and then moves into a brief overview of the concept.  Then come the recipes. A really tempting assortment of meals, 'light bites' and even a few treats.  At the back of the book is a Fast 800 Tool Kit - hints and tips for making the pan work for you. Also included are some sample meal plans.  My book arrived today, and I am already planning on making the Courgette Soup (it includes coconut milk and some spicy ginger)...the apple 'blinis' (I'm already an aficionado of courgette 'canapes') ....Chicken Katsu Curry (who doesn't love a curry!!!)..the Chickpea Patties...and then there is the fascinating sounding Chocolate and Black Bean Torte (which serves 12 but is thankfully freezable!!)  Beautifully illustrated with photographs throughout, this book is packed with inspiration.","<span>I will start by saying that I have been Intermittent Fasting for some time, initially with the 5:2 plan and then following the refinements in the Fast 800.

Beautifully written, it’s relatable but could be triggering in parts, it’s sad but there’s hope and a way out. You get invested in the hope.  Yes it does have some rather steamy scenes but with a cold realistic take on what abuse can do to a young woman and how she’s brave enough to put a stop to it holding her abuser accountable. It’s empowering, thoughtful and gripping.  However I do agree with other reviews I’ve seen. The way it’s portrayed by a lot is more focused on romance when there is domestic abuse involved which shouldn’t just be swept under the rug when promoting the book to others.  I think the book is a real page turner and your sucked in by tear jerker moments and finally relieved after you’ve been routing for Lilly throughout.

R3MHU9FYPNWLEL,An emotional rollercoaster from the beginning,"🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟This was an emotional rollercoaster from the beginning. Both the past and present storylines pack an angsty punch. The fairy-tale seeming relationship that despondent Lily finds with Ryle was exciting and loving until his true colours show and his manipulative, abusive and controlling nature rears its ugly head. Lily was an easy character to connect with and this fact made it so sad to watch her struggle with her deep love for Ryle being eroded by his harmful behaviour and her mental health suffer as she was continuously traumatised. Meanwhile, her past love story with Atlas was beautifully poignant and so rich with a mutual devotion and understanding. I fell in love with Atlas straight away as the damaged but tender boy in need of love. This book was by no means an easy read and dealt with topics of domestic violence, child neglect, mental, physical, and emotional trauma while also covering the process of trying to find help and freedom from oppressive situations.

R33I51NP3DNOXE,Impactful,"It Ends With Us is the story of Lily as she navigates her way through an abusive relationship. Her boyfriend, and later husband, Ryle, can be kind and funny and enigmatic, he is successful and driven, however none of that changes the fact that at his worst she is terrified of him. Growing up witness to a father who abused her mother, Lily always swore to herself she would never be such a woman, and yet now she finds herself making allowances for Ryle time and time again. Matters are only complicated further when a face from her past shows up, Atlas, her first love. What path will Lily choose for herself, and will she find the strength to break this cycle of abuse?  I've put off reading this book for a while, despite all the hype around it. However, having read Verity, also by Colleen Hoover not long ago, I finally decided to give this book a try. My overall thoughts are that this book is far from perfect, indeed there were parts that really grated on my nerves, however, despite its flaws, its overall message was really strong, and resonated even more after reading the author's note at the end. As such I have to applaud Colleen for writing a story that was so close to home, and for trying to get into Lily's mindset, as her story is surely one that will resonate with many.  As Colleen points out many times in the book, from the outside it seems such a simple and straightforward matter, that if you are in an abusive relationship you walk away from it. However, the reality is never so easy, and there can be so many factors in play. I particularly liked the emphasis on cycles and patterns of abuse, how Lily found herself in the same situation as her mother all those years ago, and the fact that we have glimpses into Lily's childhood helps to gain a deeper insight into her character and background. Ultimately, this story is about finding the strength to break such a cycle, and I think Colleen did a good job of showing Lily's journey to this point.  My main criticism is that I felt some of the writing and characters came across as immature. Lily and Ryle, and even Alysa often acted more like teenagers as opposed to grown adults, and Lily and Ryle's relationship felt rather adolescent. Strangely enough, the teenage Lily and the actual adolescent relationship depicted between Lily and Atlas felt more mature in comparison, such that it was as if Lily had regressed later on in life.  I'm sure that Colleen wants the reader to like Ryle to begin with, and yet to me he felt off from the very beginning. He was simply so intense and self-centred, and the relationship that develops between Lily and Ryle felt superficial such that I was never really invested in it to begin with. To be honest their relationship felt a bit too Fifty Shades of Grey, with Ryle too much a Christian Grey type character. As such I often found myself irritated at the chapters that focused on Lily and Ryle's developing relationship and when they're all loved up, as the tone just wasn't really for me, and to be honest was a bit cringey.  In contrast the chapters we have that focus on Lily as a teenager and her relationship with Atlas I loved. As well as showing the impact that her parents' relationship has on her growing up, we have this touching and sweet relationship that develops between Atlas and Lily. Atlas' personal story is also a really sad one, with important subjects such as homelessness explored, and I loved his resilience and how these two were always there supporting each other through all their trials. I did like though that later on Atlas doesn't necessarily rescue Lily like some knight in shining armour; he is there when she needs him certainly, but she has to rescue herself.  I loved that Alysa was there for Lily as a friend, despite the fact she was Ryle's sister. There was also a touching scene towards the end between Lily and her mother that I particularly appreciated.  Overall there were parts of this book that I adored (namely anything to do with Lily and Atlas) and parts that were very powerful and impactful. Unfortunately, elements of the writing and character development did for me personally affect my enjoyment of the story, and I would have likely rated it higher had the overall tone been more mature than it was.","<span>It Ends With Us is the story of Lily as she navigates her way through an abusive relationship.

There was also a touching scene towards the end between Lily and her mother that I particularly appreciated.<br><br>Overall there were parts of this book that I adored (namely anything to do with Lily and Atlas) and parts that were very powerful and impactful. Unfortunately, elements of the writing and character development did for me personally affect my enjoyment of the story, and I would have likely rated it higher had the overall tone been more mature than it was.</span>",4,False,True,gb,False,1,2,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 December 2022,2022-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,little bookworm,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/a792ae9f-5340-4a55-834b-6a0ef0834311._CR0,0,90,90_UX110_.jpg",52.0,1471156265,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R33I51NP3DNOXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1471156265,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQOSFTKUQONWQEGGMSRLFGLUBRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AGQOSFTKUQONWQEGGMSRLFGLUBRA,,,

R2S6HUDF0XQWO0,It Ends With Us Review,"This was the first book I read by Colleen Hoover and I can only blame myself for getting drawn in by the surge in popularity of this book, enough to make me pick up a copy.  I went into this book with a blind eye, not entirely sure what to expect. The book itself is advertised and sold as a ‘romance’ story, which is very misleading because it isn’t a traditional love story or even a romantic novel. No. It’s a story that depicts domestic violence, with Lily’s father abusing her mother throughout the entirety of her childhood and Lily finding herself in an abusive relationship with Ryle.  I strongly believe the novel should have incorporated a content warning outlining the themes and issues that are to be discussed in the book. With the book’s continuous growth in popularity across BookTok, there’s even more of a reason for this book to contain a content warning given that it’s likely being consumed by a younger audience and most especially, for people who may have unfortunately endured similar experiences. Although some may argue that content warnings spoil the nature of the storyline, I don’t believe this would have taken away the impact of the story. It would have instead prepared readers for a potentially difficult read. Right towards the end of the book, there is a note on who you can contact if you or someone you know is / has experienced issues discussed in the book which for me feels like a formality once you get through the entirety of the story.  I found a large number of the characters in It Ends With Us to be unoriginal and stereotypical. A woman named Lily Bloom who runs a florist? Groundbreaking. I also found it difficult to connect with the characters and because of that, I had little interest or patience in watching how the story develops, most especially in the first part of the novel. Yes I’m still yet to recover from Lily’s weird obsession with writing diary entries to Ellen Degeneres (of all people).  In terms of the writing style, I found it to be rushed. The book features a whole bunch of time jumps which I was not a huge fan of. It pulled me out of the story’s timeline too many times and this made me feel as though I were playing catch up or like Colleen Hoover was rushing to get somewhere else and cover another subject. I think more detail could have been added in certain parts too, for example, more of an insight could have been given into the journey and the challenging process of how Lily decided to forgive her abuser. Same with the ending of the book, I don’t think it makes much sense to leave the story where it was left. The consequences of Lily’s final and most important choice could have been explored in the final chapters.  One of the worst parts which I haven’t gotten round to discussing yet is the fact Colleen Hoover was planning on making a novel about a sensitive topic like domestic violence into something as light-hearted as a colouring book. I don’t even know where to begin with unpacking that.","<span>This was the first book I read by Colleen Hoover and I can only blame myself for getting drawn in by the surge in popularity of this book, enough to make me pick up a copy.<br><br>I went into this book with a blind eye, not entirely sure what to expect.

Bad things: as much as I liked her realism, I found so hard to believe/imagine that the mc’s are so young and SO successful in their lives (the only one I think was ok was Atlas). I found hard to understand the decisions Lily made and thought that there was a second chance and it might had helped but I don’t want to say more without making any spoilers.

R3D29FFMXO7TU3,Almost hit the mark for me,"I bought this book based on the hype about how moving and emotional it is and how it stays with you. As a sadness fiend, I had to investigate. Now, of course the impact of the book is going to be subjective for each individual and naturally the hype of it being the kind of book to tear you up is readers own opinions and not a claim from the author herself. So without spoilers:  I found it a pretty easy read - the pace of the storytelling means it’s easy to pick up and down as you like, but also easy and good enough to keep reading on and on and on. I think the author did a great job linking the past and present too, with no plot holes or confusing concepts anywhere. Very straightforward and easy to follow.  As for the things I didn’t like so much. I like to feel immersed in a book and my enjoyment of reading fiction tends to come from feeling an emotional response to characters, which requires a strong level of realistic writing. Some of the characters names are so odd and clunky, combined with a lot of speech nobody, especially not people in the age range of the characters, would use in real life stopped me fully being immersed and invested in this book. Whilst the pace of storytelling offered the flexibility of having fulfilling short OR long reading sessions, I felt the book was too short for the nature of the storylines. I feel the plot would’ve have a stronger impact on me if there was more character/relationship development built up before things unfolded. I didn’t get the chance to really feel that much towards any of the characters before things started happening with them, which reduced my emotional investment in the storyline to some degree. Such heavy subject matter could easily benefit from another 100 or so pages to really lay down the foundations of developing strong feelings about the characters and being truly invested in what happens with them.  Overall I would definitely say it’s worth a read. It was a really good book that I enjoyed a lot. It triggered the most emotional response from me whilst key events were unfolding midway through but then somewhat trailed out from there towards the end. Preference is of course a factor and I don’t doubt other people genuinely felt differently, but I didn’t find it to be the gut punching story a lot of people made it out to be. I think I’d have enjoyed it a lot more if I wasn’t holding it to that standard before reading and just went by the blurb on the book to be honest. There’s a lot of paths the storylines could’ve taken that would’ve ripped nearly anyones heart out, but I don’t think that was the authors intention hence why she didn’t go down that route. It feels conflicting and somewhat unfair to factor in my expectation of an unimaginably sad story based on user reviews when it’s actually not what the book itself advertises, but my intention is just to leave my opinions on what to truly expect from this book before going into it.","<span>I bought this book based on the hype about how moving and emotional it is and how it stays with you.

R3AWEAY07QAHU0,I've loved every CoHo book I've ever read but this one is miles above them all. Absolutely INCREDIBLE!,"""Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.""  I don't think I have cried so much at a book, or had such a massive bookish hangover since I read Noughts and Crosses (Malorie Blackman) when I was 12 years old. This book was so different to what I expected it to be but so much more than I had hoped it would be and it took me 2 whole days to recover before I could even begin to attempt to write a review for this book.  I started this book after getting home from work, absolutely knackered but kept awake by my excitement to start reading this book, and finished it within 4 hours (totally beat Amazon's 7 hours estimated reading time!). It then took me another hour to calm down before I could even think about going to bed and the next morning I feel totally emotionally exhausted.  I couldn't put the book down, nor did I want to. I have to admit to a couple of mini breaks in order to wipe the heavy amount of tears from my eyes and prepare myself for what was coming next, but other than that I read this book in one go.  CoHo has written us some amazing characters to fall in love with in the past, but I don't think I have ever been so proud of a heroine (CoHo's or anyone else's) than I was of Lily in this book. I loved her from page one and my admiration for her and her strength and conviction only grew the more I got into the book. She was real and vulnerable and she managed to find the strength to make the right choice in the hardest of situations. I honesty don't think I've admired a character more, and I feel like she is a heroine not just in this book, but for every girl and woman to look up to and be inspired by.  I want to clear up one thing in this review, and it is the only thing I will say about the story line of this book. Do not be afraid of a love triangle. After reading the description it was exactly where my mind went to, but having read a lot of CoHo books before I totally trusted her, and it was the right thing to do. Yes, there are two male characters in this book, but in no way are they or a love triangle the focus of this book. The story is so much bigger than them and I really hope that people don't get scared away from this book because of an assumed love triangle.  There is a very powerful message that is woven into this book, right from chapter one. It starts subtle, but as you read on you start to realise just how significant these moments are as the story comes together and gives us a raw and honest portrayal of a very realistic story.  I've purposely said very little to nothing about the storyline because everyone should go into this book blind, that way you won;t expect anything. This is very important because it is totally unexpected for our heroine too. We realise at the same time as our MC the situation she has ended up in and this allows us to experience her journey with her, which makes it all the more powerful.  We often hear authors telling us about how much of themselves they have poured into their books, and this book must have had gallons from CoHo, which is proved to us by the honesty of her authors note. I can honesty say that I have only cried at one other authors note before (Sweet Fall - Tillie Cole) but CoHo deserved every single one of my tears.

""That’s what fifteen minutes can do to a person. It can destroy them. It can save them.""","<span>""Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.""<br><br>I don't think I have cried so much at a book, or had such a massive bookish hangover since I read Noughts and Crosses (Malorie Blackman) when I was 12 years old. This book was so different to what I expected it to be but so much more than I had hoped it would be and it took me 2 whole days to recover before I could even begin to attempt to write a review for this book.<br><br>I started this book after getting home from work, absolutely knackered but kept awake by my excitement to start reading this book, and finished it within 4 hours (totally beat Amazon's 7 hours estimated reading time!). It then took me another hour to calm down before I could even think about going to bed and the next morning I feel totally emotionally exhausted.<br><br>I couldn't put the book down, nor did I want to. I have to admit to a couple of mini breaks in order to wipe the heavy amount of tears from my eyes and prepare myself for what was coming next, but other than that I read this book in one go.<br><br>CoHo has written us some amazing characters to fall in love with in the past, but I don't think I have ever been so proud of a heroine (CoHo's or anyone else's) than I was of Lily in this book. I loved her from page one and my admiration for her and her strength and conviction only grew the more I got into the book. She was real and vulnerable and she managed to find the strength to make the right choice in the hardest of situations. I honesty don't think I've admired a character more, and I feel like she is a heroine not just in this book, but for every girl and woman to look up to and be inspired by.<br><br>I want to clear up one thing in this review, and it is the only thing I will say about the story line of this book. Do not be afraid of a love triangle. After reading the description it was exactly where my mind went to, but having read a lot of CoHo books before I totally trusted her, and it was the right thing to do. Yes, there are two male characters in this book, but in no way are they or a love triangle the focus of this book. The story is so much bigger than them and I really hope that people don't get scared away from this book because of an assumed love triangle.<br><br>There is a very powerful message that is woven into this book, right from chapter one. It starts subtle, but as you read on you start to realise just how significant these moments are as the story comes together and gives us a raw and honest portrayal of a very realistic story.<br><br>I've purposely said very little to nothing about the storyline because everyone should go into this book blind, that way you won;t expect anything. This is very important because it is totally unexpected for our heroine too. We realise at the same time as our MC the situation she has ended up in and this allows us to experience her journey with her, which makes it all the more powerful.<br><br>We often hear authors telling us about how much of themselves they have poured into their books, and this book must have had gallons from CoHo, which is proved to us by the honesty of her authors note. I can honesty say that I have only cried at one other authors note before (Sweet Fall - Tillie Cole) but CoHo deserved every single one of my tears.<br><br>On a final note I have to say how much I love the title and cover of this book, the reasoning for both becomes apparent as you read the book, and for the title especially has a very strong impact emotionally.<br><br>""That’s what fifteen minutes can do to a person.

And later on we discover that Ryle also had an emotional trauma in his early childhood which has left him scarred too – which explains a lot about him and it’s a clever reveal when we do get to find out about his past.  This is a book about love, loyalty, friendship and domestic violence and its complex and it was an interesting read. Does it merit all the hoo-ha? Personally I don’t think so. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoyed the book but in the way I have enjoyed countless books which have not had 1 million sales and a film deal. This is not sour grapes, this is just how it is. Colleen Hoover got lucky with the book review by an internet influencer.

R2E6G1KD3YE3YR,"A good, pleasant read (and only that)","The 2000s have seen a wave of books quite successful, mostly well-written and in which the main character is a young lady. The plots in these works deal, almost always with said young lady and her very troubled relationship with men. Think of ""Gone girl"", ""The Girl on a Train"", the Sally Rooney's opuses and now Colleen Hoover's books, only to name only a few of the most successful ones. And yes, all these books are written also by young ladies. ""It Ends with Us"" belongs by and large to that category of short-ish tales crowded with middle-class and screamingly urbanite characters, all well-educated, well-spoken and professional; permanently busy - at work and also with worthy hobbies (or ""causes"") -, and all very good or very bad - yet seldom human - whose stories make for a good read. ""It Ends..."" is quite short, almost a novella, but has been bloated into a ""normal-sized"" book by means of a large font and smaller pages - it happens a lot these days. As I said above, the book makes for a good read, at times actually gripping, but it never becomes a major, never mind transcendental, experience. It fails to leave in the reader the unequivocal flavor of really good literature due to several reasons. First, to these eyes is that there are way too many coincidences for such a short book - there're only coincidences in the plot. Without spoiling anything: the main character, our heroine, has a love story at a young age. It ends abruptly and when she has a new boyfriend they go to dinner and the chef of the restaurant is her previous lover; a character opens a business and someone comes looking for a job, and this someone happens to be the sister of a key character we've been introduced two pages before. And so forth. At some point, the reader has the sensation of being in a parallel (and impossible) universe, it's all way too neat and schematic. Also, the book has too much dialogue (and phone texting - the sign of these times), so much that at parts the text seems like a draft for a movie screenplay and the reader does't have time to enjoy the parts of good prose. It doesn't help that the characters are always in motion, (even while talking to each other): coming or going, buying, eating, cleaning an apartment and shopping; there's little time for pause or reflection. Again without spoiling anything, the core of the book deals with domestic abuse and this is, by far, the best part. The scenes that deal with the violence are very well written, some of the best in recent publishing about that horrific plague, and all told in a very well-handled first-person voice. In conclusion, a very short book that can be read in one sit. A pleasant and easy read? Without a doubt. Worthy, transcendent literature?

R1CM8D3UBC6VSL,A powerful read!,"**TW** Domestic ab*se, r*pe, manipulation, s*icide, homelessness, child neglect, death, substance ab*se This book contains a lot of sensitive themes, if a sensitive reader, this book may not be suited for you.  Where to begin? This book was powerful in its own way. The character development of Lily was amazing and she definitely showed what it was like to come out on the brighter side.  Her relationship with Ryle though, that was clearly toxic from the start with many red flags to view. But she loved him and it can be difficult to see past the love you have for someone. There were scenes where he was kind and gentle with her but coming into the middle of the book, and onwards, his behavior started to change and his attitude towards Lily was not at all kind and gentle. Reading the interactions they have together really makes you think long and hard about the type of people they are. Yes, they cared for each other, but they had to think of themselves too. Lily's mother gave some great advice towards the end of the book and I love that.  Speaking of Lily's mother, their relationship had some great development as we got further and further into the book. Their bond grew stronger as they found some common ground. Lily's mother gently pushed her daughter to make the decision that kept her safe.  Of course, if anyone has been on TikTok or Instagram, then you know there is another love interest mentioned in this book and his name is Atlas. Dear, sweet Atlas. Always compassionate Atlas. Our first encounters with him are mostly through Lily's journals and we learn an awful lot about his character. At such a young age, Lily showed strong compassion and determination when it came to Atlas, and giving him what felt like a home, and he never once took advantage of her. Their connection with Ellen DeGeneres was beautiful and the continuing messages of 'Just Keep Swimming' was enough to put a sop smile on my face while reading.  The ending of this book was beautiful. I loved that there was a positive and that everything seemed to start to slot itself in place. It truly showed the development of Lily's character. And, as her mother said, Lily is definitely brave and bold.  This book deals with many issues that people face in real life and it truly gets you thinking about your own life and values. Many people have advertised this book as a romance, but I see it differently, it's a book of life. Of a difficult life that does have a brighter outcome. Even when everything may feel wrong, it can get better.  I do highly recommend this book and I look forward to reading more of Colleen Hoover's books in the near future.","<span>**TW**<br>Domestic ab*se, r*pe, manipulation, s*icide, homelessness, child neglect, death, substance ab*se<br>This book contains a lot of sensitive themes, if a sensitive reader, this book may not be suited for you.<br><br>Where to begin?

RTAUZ92OAA7T2,Navigating Life with the Highway Code: A Comedy of Errors and Unexpected Romance!,"So, there I was, thinking I could be the James Bond of road safety with the official Highway Code. Little did I know, this innocent guide would turn my life into a slapstick comedy filled with more twists and turns than a rollercoaster.  Let's start with a date night disaster. Eager to showcase my knowledge of traffic signs and road etiquette, I decided to bring the Highway Code to the dinner table. As I enthusiastically explained the nuances of a roundabout, my date, instead of being impressed, was left questioning her life choices and contemplating the quickest route to an escape. Turns out, romance doesn't blossom in the shadow of road signs.  Undeterred, I figured, why not bring this enlightening guide to a family gathering with the in-laws? Picture me, attempting to impress them with my newfound road wisdom. Little did I anticipate that my attempt to educate would lead to a heated debate on the correct hand signal for turning left. The family BBQ turned into a crash course in signaling, and my credibility as a road scholar plummeted.  But wait, there's more! In a misguided attempt to impress my boss at work, I thought a surprise presentation on road safety would secure my position as the office road guru. Enter the Highway Code, my ticket to success. However, my boss wasn't thrilled about the unexpected traffic lecture, especially when it turned into a full-blown simulation of a roundabout in the middle of the office. Let's just say my employment status hit a roadblock, and I was handed my walking papers.  Now, let's talk about the not-so-great feature of this product—the weight. In a moment of misjudgment, I used it as a makeshift dumbbell during a team-building exercise at work. Little did I know, the boss wasn't a fan of impromptu weightlifting sessions, and my attempt at multitasking turned into a career-ending heavy lifting mishap.  But it's not all roadblocks and detours. The Highway Code possesses an unexpected allure that has turned me into a magnet for women—swimsuit models, to be precise. Somehow, the knowledge of road safety has become my secret weapon in the dating game. I'm now so busy decoding signals and road signs that I've had to hire a personal assistant to keep up.  In conclusion, the official Highway Code isn't just a road safety guide; it's a comedy script waiting to happen. Bravo, Highway Code, for turning my life into a chaotic journey filled with roadblocks, romance, and a lot of ""yield"" signs!","<span>So, there I was, thinking I could be the James Bond of road safety with the official Highway Code.

Rather than attack the author, which they inevitably do, why not suspend your ad-hom for second, read the book and assess the actual content.  Anyway, the brief review, from someone who has actually read the book...  Its a succinct and well read assessment of various political actors and institutions over the last few years. Set with a list, broadly chronological, of ten individuals it sets out their agenda, their backgrounds and their associations. James has an ego, which comes across in the book, but which is probably par the course for the role he has on his radio show. But, despite this, the book is funny, depressing and a serious wake-up call to those who have been accepting of the way that our politics has been bent out of shape by characters who have no public interest (Corbyn probably the exception) at the heart of what they have been doing over the last 13 years and more. That Johnson wrote both a pro and con letter for Brexit shows the utter contempt for the public and truth that he had with the only person he ever cared about being his own advancement.  No book is perfect and this is no exception. As a proud centrist, I listen to James' show, as consequently much of his opinion and subject matter I am familiar with and for that 4 stars seems appropriate for me. I woud have liked him to have dug deeper into the characters and given more about their motivations, but also their final objectives.  Nevertheless, this is essential reading for the pragmatic, middle ground supporter who longs for sensible grown up politics to return to the UK.

R1MYZACJ29RH2P,Broken Britain - not just in a High Street chain pub on a weekday morning,"Articulate, thorough and very well informed, this is a comprehensive and withering takedown of the incompetent and malign forces which have conspired to render life in the UK increasingly fraught and materially poorer over the last decade and a half. It is also, for the most part, very well written; the quality of O’Brien’s prose is significantly better than, I suspect, anything which could be mustered by any of his subjects. Never mind the ranting, semi-literate headline writing of the newspaper men which he portrays, none of the prose churned out by Cameron, Johnson, et al is as erudite, nuanced or perceptive as that which O’Brien pens. When you read early in the introduction that this is, “…a tale of loss and betrayal; of unbridled arrogance and unchallenged ignorance; of personal impunity, warped ideology and political incompetence” it is clear that, if nothing else, you’re likely to be in for an interesting ride. The 45 page introduction lies at the heart of the book and, in it, O’Brien describes how a convergence of self-interested actors has generated an economic, media and political ecosystem in which inequality has been encouraged to flourish, in which everyone except the already powerful and wealthy have become less powerful and less wealthy and in which, ultimately, the country has lost itself and become broken. Time was when “Broken Britain” was only to be found enjoying a second pint of cheap, industrial lager in a High Street chain pub at 10.15.am. on a weekday morning; now, O’Brien demonstrates, it is all pervasive. His subsequent chapters, battering the reputations of nine of the individuals who have done the damage, are – by definition – less wide ranging but my, doesn’t O’Brien do a good job? His combination of exhaustively researched (and referenced) factual reporting with pointed, wry analysis is difficult to resist and, as page succeeds page and the evidence mounts up, the accuracy of his scrutiny becomes both irrefutable and rather overwhelming. O’Brien reserves much of his best writing for Cameron, nailing his lazy lies about the origins of the financial crisis and his stupidity at being pulled into the Brexit referendum (and then, worse, losing it) with a comprehensive attention to detail which many other commentators would do well to emulate. He does not, perhaps, do full justice to Cameron’s blithe insouciance on walking away from the mess he created and he could probably have paid some attention to the Greensill Scandal while, equally, the book was written too early to document the entitled exceptionalism which underpinned Cameron’s unexpected return to public life as Foreign Secretary – but, all that said, O’Brien pulls no punches. I particularly like his use of a quotation from Cameron’s (excruciating) autobiography about his “growing sense of being mediocre” as a schoolboy at the end of the chapter. This is not to suggest that O’Brien isn’t excoriatingly brilliant elsewhere. His relatively sympathetic depiction of Cummings as principled but deluded – a solipsistic ideologue who, in contrast to those whom he served, was actually trying to act in the best interests of the country – is engaging and, of course, his final chapters on Johnson and Truss are, if clearly predictable, to the point. While, like many, I was already familiar with the description of Johnson penned by his former Eton housemaster, the quotation from the institution’s former headmaster, John Claughton, was new to me and worth the price of the book alone. All things considered, then, this is not to be missed, a recommendation which, fascinatingly, is not shared by the largely ad hominem one star reviews on this site. Which serfs from Tufton Street were drafted in to write them, I wonder?","<span>Articulate, thorough and very well informed, this is a comprehensive and withering takedown of the incompetent and malign forces which have conspired to render life in the UK increasingly fraught and materially poorer over the last decade and a half.

He does not, perhaps, do full justice to Cameron’s blithe insouciance on walking away from the mess he created and he could probably have paid some attention to the Greensill Scandal while, equally, the book was written too early to document the entitled exceptionalism which underpinned Cameron’s unexpected return to public life as Foreign Secretary – but, all that said, O’Brien pulls no punches. I particularly like his use of a quotation from Cameron’s (excruciating) autobiography about his “growing sense of being mediocre” as a schoolboy at the end of the chapter.<br>This is not to suggest that O’Brien isn’t excoriatingly brilliant elsewhere. His relatively sympathetic depiction of Cummings as principled but deluded – a solipsistic ideologue who, in contrast to those whom he served, was actually trying to act in the best interests of the country – is engaging and, of course, his final chapters on Johnson and Truss are, if clearly predictable, to the point. While, like many, I was already familiar with the description of Johnson penned by his former Eton housemaster, the quotation from the institution’s former headmaster, John Claughton, was new to me and worth the price of the book alone.<br>All things considered, then, this is not to be missed, a recommendation which, fascinatingly, is not shared by the largely ad hominem one star reviews on this site. Which serfs from Tufton Street were drafted in to write them, I wonder?</span>",5,False,True,gb,False,4,1,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2024,2024-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,Chris H,,104.0,0753560364,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R1MYZACJ29RH2P?ASIN=0753560364,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGFYEZWQ5HYWGSP7CK53ZW44DC2Q,AGFYEZWQ5HYWGSP7CK53ZW44DC2Q,,,

R1WDR4WAOIK6PH,Ten Characters in Search of an Author,"This is a book about ten characters and “How they broke Britain”, written by the well-known LBC presenter and journalist James O’Brien. Although each chapter is named after one of the characters who helped to “break Britain”, these are not biographies, but journalistic accounts of these characters and their malign influence and actions.  I assume that the journalistic approach includes thorough fact-checking, so the accounts in each chapter can be believed (1). Many of the characters are well known. Rupert Murdoch is a media mogul, Paul Dacre was the editor of the Daily Mail, Andrew Neil works in the media and Jeremy Corbyn (2) was Leader of the Labour Party. David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss were all Prime Ministers. Dominic Cummings was a director of Vote Leave and later worked for Boris Johnson. Matthew Elliott may not be so familiar. He was the chief executive of Vote Leave. Many others could have been included, but presumably fell foul of lack of space in the book, anonymity and the libel lawyers.  THE HARDBACK begins with a substantial Introduction of 45 pages, followed by 10 chapters, totalling 347 pages of text. This is followed by 10 pages of Notes, which are all short references to media sources (3). There are no illustrations and no Index.  THE PAPERBACK contains additional information to the hardback and also includes an index.  ___________________________________________________________________ (1) Fact-checking may not be assumed for Rupert Murdoch’s Fox News. The facts will be ignored if it is better for the ratings to run false stories. For the British newspapers, the facts do not always need to be checked because they have been obtained by phone hacking, for which the results are always true.  (2) Parts of the chapter on Jeremy Corbyn come from the author’s review in the Times Literary Supplement ofProtest and Power: The Battle for the Labour Party by David Kogan.  (3) CONTENTS (HARDBACK)  Epigraph  ‘As long as the general population is passive, apathetic, diverted to consumerism or hatred of the vulnerable, then the powerful can do as they please, and those who survive will be left to contemplate the outcome’ Noam Chomsky (“Who Owns the World”)  Introduction (45 pages)  Chapter 1 Rupert Murdoch (34 pages)  Asked why he allowed a major advertiser on Fox News to make outlandish claims of election fraud lies Rupert Murdoch explained that it was a financial and not a political decision and said that “it is not red or blue, it is green” (page 56) that is, not Republican nor Democrat but green for money. Rupert Murdoch was born into the newspaper business and has been quoted as saying that ‘The press should be anti-establishment, should keep its distance from authority . . . from big business and all vested interests. It’s only natural that it should questioning and sceptical.’ (pages 61/62). What happened? Fox News happened. Fox News became and remains the most profitable news channel in the world. It showed that millions could be made from right-wing media. See alsoMurdoch’s Politics by David McKnight.  Chapter 2 Paul Dacre (32 pages)  Paul Dacre was editor of the Daily Mail for 26 years and is now chairman of the holding company. A contributor to the unauthorised history of the Daily Mail,Mail Men by Adrian Addison, was quoted as saying that “I felt Dacre just saw life – the world – as an awful, threatening place where he wanted to be in his bunker. Firing salvos out, you know – blowing up his enemies. That bunker mentality.” (Chapter 2, page 83) This chapter mainly concerns examples of Daily Mail journalism, with Paul Dacre firing salvos from his bunker towards anti-Brexiteers, international institutions, the Blob, the Woke and the judges. “In February 2017, the unpaid and anonymous editors of Wikipedia voted overwhelmingly to ban the Daily Mail as a trusted source for the website, describing it as ‘generally unreliable’ and calling for ‘its use as a reference is to be generally prohibited, especially when other more reliable sources exist’.” (Chapter 2, page 89)  Chapter 3 Andrew Neil (32 pages)  “Andrew Neil may not seem an obvious person for inclusion in this book, but both his career and his impact are a perfect illustration of what has happened to this country.” (Chapter 3, page 113)  Chapter 4 Matthew Elliott (36 pages)  Matthew Elliott may not be familiar to readers. He was the chief executive of Vote Leave and the start of this chapter discusses his problems with the Electoral Commission over electoral expenses. It continues with his co-founding of the “Tax Payers Alliance” (TPA) in 2004 and the Conservative Friends of Russia (CFoR) in 20212 and the Eurosceptic “Business for Britain” in 2013. Think tanks have their origins in genuine research groups. For example, in the 1950s Anthony Fisher was so impressed by Friederich Hayek’s bookThe Road to Serfdom that he set up the Institute of Economic Affairs. Nowadays, think tanks are really lobby groups, often supported by anonymous donors, promoting extreme free-market or libertarian views intended to favour the business interest and the wealthy or both. They have morphed into organisations “dedicated to promoting greed, protecting greed and serving the interests of the greedy.” (page 151)  Chapter 5 Nigel Farage (37 pages)  The image of Nigel Farage is of a public school educated, pantomime “toff” that people generally like. However, this chapter begins not with Nigel Farage, but with Nick Griffin of the far-right/fascist British National Party (BNP) and his appearance on the BBC’s Question Time (QT) in October 2009. He had been elected to the European Parliament a few months before. Using this QT appearance as a link, the chapter then says Nigel Farage was one of the most frequent quests on QT of all time. particularly as the chapter continues to say that Nigel Farage is a liar and a racist. The chapter then reproduces an edited version of an interview at LBC between Nigel Farage and the author, James O’Brien. The author comments “It was, to say the least, an illuminating experience, although ultimately, a futile one. In the context I’ve outlined here, where Farage is essentially Nick Griffin in a more palatable guise – an inveterate liar, a facilitator of far-right politics and overtly, albeit smilingly, racist – some moments stand out more than others.” (page 203)  Chapter 6 David Cameron (29 pages)  David Cameron, educated at Eton and Oxford, came from a privileged background where he was part of the social hierarchy. He became Prime Minister at just 43 years old with no serious frontline political experience. At the time his future was considered very promising. For party political reasons he initiated the Brexit Referendum, lost the referendum, and then resigned.  Chapter 7 Jeremy Corbyn (28 pages)  Jeremy Corbyn was an accidental leader of the Labour Party. Changes made to the party’s voting rules and the feeling amongst some Labour MPs that a representative from the left should be on the ballot ‘for balance’ were the cause. Whatever the problem, Jeremy Corbyn turned out not to be the solution as he avoided interviews, waved through Brexit and handed Boris Johnson an historic majority. See alsoProtest and Power: The Battle for the Labour Party by David Kogan andAll Out War by Tim Shipman.  Chapter 8 Dominic Cummings (30 pages)  The contribution of Dominic Cummings to the breaking of Britain is immense. He delivered the Brexit referendum result and steered Boris Johnson to an 80-seat majority. Strangely, he considers that he is working in the best interests of the country. Others consider him deluded and a little crazy. He reciprocates by holding most others in contempt. He seems to consider that the end justifies the means. However, he is not interested in personal enrichment, advancement or status, and this provides him with both detachment and independence.  Chapter 9 Boris Johnson (33 pages)  Boris Johnson is immune to the truth, but he is entertaining and is often very funny, like all good snake oil salesmen. This chapter documents a selection of his scandals. See alsoThe Assault on Truth by Peter Oborne, 2021.  Chapter 10 Liz Truss (9 pages)  Liz Truss was deeply embedded in the secretly funded think-tank universe. She also understood that it was more effective to tell voters only what they wanted to hear. Her elevation to Prime Minister turned Britain into a think-tank laboratory. The first and only experiment was introduced by Kwasi Kwarteng’s mini budget. This was praised by the right-wing media/Tory party/think-tank nexus, but it badly spooked the financial markets. Liz Truss resigned after forty-five days in office. The mini budget inflicted an estimated £30 billion worth of damage on the UK economy (Observer, 12-Nov-2022).

ROA6UGI5RKJY0,Neither entertaining or enjoyable but very interesting,"This was my first experience of James O'Brien, having been recommended to him by a friend. I'd been cautious about him previously, unsure about the foundations of his opinions and hesitant to encourage his hatred of so many people. Looking at the back of the book I was impressed by the range of people who were quoted and decided to give this a go. The book is 347 pages split into 10 chapters, each focused around a name individual. I was reading the hardback, first published in 2023. The introduction is a hefty piece of writing, summarising the last 10 years of conservative government from an unacknowledged left leaning author. There is little in here that will surprise and, of course, statistics are used selectively to back his arguments. It is a clever start though and works to encourage the reader to start thinking. It presents an environment of cronyism and self protection which the individuals covered will then develop. Whilst reading I found myself swinging between laughing out loud at the lack of balance then diving into depths of despair at the hopelessness of the country. The purpose of the book is to name and shame which it does perfectly. It will support the opinions of many people and, at that level, it succeeds. Rarely does he challenge his own opinions and there is not enough balance for me to treat the whole book too seriously though. His approach is extremely negative and I needed some hope that the current situation will pass. It's easy to criticise everyone but not so easy to look for solutions. The overall result is a simplistic analysis of problems that have been chewed over many times, all be it with an updated perspective after Brexit. This is worth reading to see the views of the author, as he features a lot in popular media culture but I did not find it entertaining or enjoyable to read.","<span>This was my first experience of James O'Brien, having been recommended to him by a friend.

R3DH2BLHSZSX2C,Disappointing,"I wasn’t a big fan of O’Brien prior to reading this but I like to read things that challenge my views and a few other reviewers had said that people who disagree with him should read this book so I thought I’d give it a go.  It’s way worse than I imagined it would be. For a start he doesn’t even attempt to argue for the central thesis of the book (that things have got worse over the last ten years under the Conservative Party) many of the points he makes go back decades. Such as the collusion between government and the press. He admits this went on under Blair. In fact, he doesn’t really make arguments at all in the traditional sense. He starts with ad hominem attacks on people, straw mans their argument and then makes a sarcastic comment. This may be entertaining reading for someone who already agrees with him but it's not going to convince anyone on the fence.  For example, when he talks about Suella Braverman, he starts talking about dehumanising language. He doesn’t quote anything she says though but says someone else said she uses language such referring to refugees as a ‘swarm’. Although O’Brien has to admit she never actually said that. Then he starts talking about Priti Patel and a couple of pages later he’s talking about how a certain newspaper is ‘infested’ with people he doesn’t like and in an interview with politics Joe he called Braverman ‘ a rash’. There’s a lot of personal attacks being thrown around and not much substance. Goodwin is ‘obscure’, Cameron is a ‘Patrician’, someone else is a racist and a bigot. He’s got labels for everyone he doesn’t like. It’s reads like a fiery diatribe rather than a well researched book.  He will outright lie when it suits him as well. Such as his claim that crime in Sweden has fallen since 2006. I found this hard to believe given there have been several documentaries and news articles talking about the rise in violent crime in Sweden, so I googled it and all the data I could find showed that crime had risen. So to be fair, I had a look at the article he had referenced when he made the point and this article specifically states that crime has risen. It’s unbelievable. I guess he thought no one would check. He’s not a data person and when an issue like this arises it’s baffling that he only relies on news articles. Looking at the end notes I couldn’t find a single book he has referenced. He wrote the entire book only using news sites which shows how lightweight and undercooked this analysis is.  I understand that it is comforting to read things that support your views and we are all susceptible to confirmation bias, but I really couldn’t understand why people would recommend this book to people who don’t already agree with him as it really feels like it’s written for his own audience. I didn’t get the impression he wanted to convince me of anything and like I said, he doesn’t really argue that things have got worse over the last ten years. To do that you would need to look at what things were like ten years ago and make a comparison.

It's all here, fully researched & choc laden with fantastic rhetorical flourishes and anecdotes that emphasise the subject matter with an almost tragi-comic clarity which almost softens the actual blows we've suffered for years in the UK  It took longer to read than i expected, simply because some of the people mentioned within, weren't readily identifyable figures. As a result, it can be difficult relating to them without further research using the internet.

R1TI3WSWP2GOOI,"The Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing But the Truth","James O'Brien's latest book - following tomes on how to be right and not be wrong - is arguably his most polemical yet. Chapter by chapter, he dissects the roles that media moguls, politicians and newspaper editors have played in generating a generation's worth of failure, incompetence and downright illegality as this country has lurched from crisis to crisis, with seemingly no sign it will ever stop. Research here is key, and O'Brien's scalpel precision in both recording and retelling so many of the key stages between Rupert Murdoch's rise as a press baron to the laughably brief tenure of Liz Truss as Prime Minister. In between is made up of a frankly unbelivable-unless-it-was-true catalogue of cronyism, ill-preparedness, political gain at the expense of public wellbeing and criminal negligence. While I don't personally keep with every facet of each individual given their chapterial shame sheet, theres never the less ample fuel to stoke my personal ire. Standouts are inevitably the eviscerations of Nigel Farage, David Cameron, Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson - key architects and beneficiaries of the Brexit referendum in 2016 which provides this book with its raison d'etre. O'Brien's skilful ability to plot piece by piece how a campaign of fear-mongering, racism, divergance and sheer bloody lies enabled these crooks and swindlers to point the blame at anyone other than themselves and somehow rise their own greasy poles in the meantime. It's telling that even the data obsessed and clearly non-parliamentarian Dominic Cummings is damned by O'Brien with faint praise for often being the smartest guy in a room filled with incompetence and promotion above and beyond any actual achievement. Privilege, entitlement and a willingness for self-service above the public need are the recurrent themes that emerge, and O'Brien's book is as important a testament to How they broke Britain as the Nuremberg trials were in accounting the events of World War II. Essential reading for anyone who still thinks it's all the fault of immigrants, the badly off, the disabled and the most needy of society, who have all been betrayed by the actions of nine white men and one white woman.","<span>James O'Brien's latest book - following tomes on how to be right and not be wrong - is arguably his most polemical yet.

RG6NPRYHQZJNS,I Refreshing Dose of the Truth About Brexit,"I’m a huge fan of James O’Brien and I listen to him on the radio almost every day, so this book was always going to be a must-read for me. I remember thinking during the Brexit madness of 2016 to 2020 that the entire saga would make a great book. Well here it is!  The title of this book is misleading (if not dramatic): Britain is not broken; but it has been severely damaged by the madness and stupidity of Brexit. This book really should have been called ""How Brexit managed to happen"" because that's what it's actually about. In these pages O'Brien carefully and meticulous detail explains the process by which the UK voted for something that he sarcastically calls ""self-imposed economic sanctions"".  The way that O'Brien lays out the book is very clever. Each chapter is dedicated to one of the 10 people who O'Brien believes is responsible for the Brexit disaster happening and for subsequent later problems. From Rupert Murdoch to Liz Truss, O'Brien shows how and why theses people damaged the UK so much. The writer points to the Conservative Party and its ""client media"", i.e. the Right-wing press, Like the Daily Mail and The Telegraph; and how that close relationship was and still is used to influence millions of ordinary people in this country to vote agains their own interest.  The three characters that O'Brien has the most contempt for are Paul Dacre (the former editor of the Daily Mail), Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. O'Brien provides a forensic examination of these people and exposes just how toxic their influence has been on British society.  This is a great read.","<span>I’m a huge fan of James O’Brien and I listen to him on the radio almost every day, so this book was always going to be a must-read for me.

This is as good as anything Ms Jewell has written before, and I'd say one of her best. 'None of This Is True' is as fast, complex and as clever as can be, and actually made me gasp out loud at a stunningly audacious 'really did not see this coming' moment early on. At first it all seems pretty par for the course - Alix is character you're not going to feel much sympathy for, with her seemingly perfect and privileged lifestyle, and Josie is the one with the hard knocks and the dead ends...and yes, while'none of this is true,' but it's not a straightforward truth-for-lies swap at all, and isn't what you might expect at all. The plots twists are just superb. In terms of a reading experience, it's all there - the usual Jewell sharp eye for detail, the nailed-it descriptions and the keen ear for dialogue, all there in spades, so very skilful, and never grates; but on top of that, the plot is clever, elegant, and my gawd, is it pacey!

RNZ695B1PB6ZL,"A must read, dark psychological thriller! 🩸","'When she doesn't like the reality of things, she finds a reality she prefers.'  This is the story of Alix Summer and Josie Fair, two women both celebrating turning 45 at the same pub. In the pub toilets, they first meet and discover they are 'birthday twin's - born on the same day. Not only that, born in the same year at the same hospital. Soon, both of their lives become intertwined and nothing will ever be the same again.  I read this book at the beginning of last week and have delayed reviewing it until now, as I just couldn't find the words to describe how much I love it! It is a dark psychological thriller, full of suspense, that only gets darker the more you read- and at certain points I would say revolting. The inclusion of podcast transcripts, social media as well as the documentary aspect all add another dimension to the story. I was gripped and on edge, uncomfortable from the beginning until the end.  It is amazing to have two female protagonists at the forefront of this story, with a particular spotlight on how social media is not an accurate reflection of someone's life and nobody knows the reality of life behind closed doors. Josie is particularly complex and unhinged. She is very odd, narsasistic, obsessive and manipulative. She really is quite terrifying! Everything she does is calculated and whilst being very unlikeable, I was totally captivated by her and I can't stop thinking about her. I loved Alix. She is a woman who wants to have it all - the career, house, marriage and family. While there where times I wanted to shake her, for her to stand her ground - in relation to both Josey and Nathan, ultimately I found her very relatable. Her love for her family and wanting to protect them, shone through everything.  This is a tale about the fragility of life and how things are never as they seem. This is my favourite Lisa Jewell book by far.

R3T63AG375XHLT,Anther great read from Jewel,"Jewel never disappoints and she certainly delivers here in this brilliant holiday read, full of twists and turns that have you guessing throughout.-It's a plot of obsession, lies and murder. Alix and Josie meet by chance at a pub where they are celebrating their forty fifth birthdays. From the outside one has it all, friends, looks and fame: she produces successful podcasts while the other is full with bitterness, regrets and what could have been. After their initial introduction in the pub loos, Josie initiates another meeting whereby she offers to be the next subject on the podcast. An opportunity Alix jumps at despite her initial doubts about this rather strange woman. Josie excitingly informs her that something big is going to happen to her but first she must tell her side of her story. She begins to detail a toxic life of grooming, child abuse and domestic violence. As Alix falls deeper into her web of lies and deceit she puts her husband and family at risk and danger. Soon it is Josie calling the shots and Alix who is following blindly always one step behind. Unfortunately she realises too late just how dangerous and manipulative Josie is. Jewel's style and structure for this novel is interesting as it flips back and forth between narrative and interviews, which will contribute to a Netflix documentary series. As it progresses it captures the unraveling of Josie. highly recommend","<span>Jewel never disappoints and she certainly delivers here in this brilliant holiday read, full of twists and turns that have you guessing throughout.-It's a plot of obsession, lies and murder.<br>Alix and Josie meet by chance at a pub where they are celebrating their forty fifth birthdays.

RWYX8KZ5DVOOB,Ali Hazelwood's best book yet...,"Thank you to Little Brown Book Group and NetGalley for an advanced copy.  I absolutely loved Not in Love. I read it in a single day. It's definitely more erotic and mature than Hazelwood's previous work. There isn't an adorable meet-cute or satisfyingly slow burn. For example, the book opens with our two main characters, Rue and Eli, meeting up for no-strings-attached sex after communicating and sharing their kinks via a dating app.  The sexual chemistry is undeniable and very much at the forefront of their relationship/arrangement. The romance element, along with any vulnerability or true intimacy, slowly develops throughout as their secret affair unravels and becomes more and more complicated.  I think Rue is possibly my favourite FMC that Hazelwood has ever written. She's socially awkward, possibly neurodivergent, intelligent, brutally honest, and fiercely loyal. Both characters have a lot of past truma that effects their ability to commit to one another and I found that Rue's difficulties around food and her inability to invest in relationships was really thoughtfully written and handled beautifully. There's a lot to unpack with Rue, and I appreciated the depth Hazelwood went into in terms of her past and what motivates her professionally.  On a side note, I personally appreciated that Rue wasn't the petite and small breasted heroine I've come to expect from romance books. Her body is described as soft, curvy with a rounded stomach and hips with little imperfections that Eli counts enthusiastically and worships. I loved how this book is both body and sex positive throughout. This is my favourite romance book of the year so far.","<span>Thank you to Little Brown Book Group and NetGalley for an advanced copy.<br><br>I absolutely loved Not in Love.

R3CUB1T2HJMSBK,Another great read from the spicy STEM queen!,"TW for this book: Food insecurity, ED, parent loss, child neglect  At this stage I'm a devoted Hazelwood stan, she's as much part of my spicy shelf as Macfarlane. Absolutely adored her previous STEM books and this one definitely followed suit.  In ""Not in Love"" it feels like Hazelwood's trying to tackle trickier characters with more complex back stories, while still trying to weave their narrative into a romp across STEM politics and (in the case of this book..) copious sex scenes!

R1FF6HO8KX66E5,"Hazelwood levels up with a complex, witty and nuanced enemies-to-lovers STEM romance","This is such a complex and rewarding read, with plenty to enjoy as a fan of romance, enemies-to-lovers and all the good things. This is my first Ali Hazelwood book, incredibly, but I very much liked what I read: her writing is vibrant and witty and moreish, and not at all superficial. The story, these characters - they had a distinct identity and life, and I enjoyed spending time with them. As the heroine, Rue is a breath of fresh air - complicated, uncompromising, unabashedly herself; her vulnerability and the chemistry she shared with Eli meant that I was 100% rooting for her to come out of the whole thing with her version of a HEA. Eli was delightfully contradictory, and his self-assuredness and not-so-hidden sweetness were the perfect foil for Rue. I also loved the relationships the pair had with their respective friends, and the exploration of personal loyalty, and the difficult choice between personal interest and doing the right thing.  This is a nuanced, mature romance novel, with the right level of spice for the story - this may be more than readers of Hazelwood's previous work are used to (I'm not in a position to compare), hence the gentle 'heads up' at the beginning of the novel, but for what it's worth these scenes never feel gratuitous or anything other than grounded in character and serving the plot of the story.  Perfect for fans of Elle Kennedy and Tessa Bailey, or anyone wanting a sweet and spicy read with substance and a STEM flavour.","<span>This is such a complex and rewarding read, with plenty to enjoy as a fan of romance, enemies-to-lovers and all the good things.

The recipes are very simplistic, and there's an awful lot of 'filler'. Even the names of the recipes jarred with me; I don't care whose uncle or which grandad gave you the recipe, and I find that sort of thing very self indulgent and egotistical. What shocked me most, I think, was the paucity of fish recipes. One salmon dish? Really? Another extremely irritating aspect is the index.

I decided to try this after all the hype and having just come back from an all inclusive holiday…enough said about weight gain there. This promises a fast weight loss if you stick to 800 cals a day, also good to factor in some fasting, all explained in the books. I looked through the books and chose some breakfasts and meals for a week, did a shopping list and did a delivery shop to avoid temptation. It cost around the same as my weekly shop, the second week cheaper as I didn’t need a lot of the store cupboard items like herbs. I’ve varied the meals and they are easy to cook and very tasty. I’m quite impressed, I’ve eaten things I’ve never had before. Easy and quick, I can really recommend lovely recipies.

(My grown up kids, girlfriends etc and gym enthusiast husband, all like to do their own food) Usually i can’t be bothered with recipes as too many ingredients puts me off. Apart from some store cupboard items that i needed to get going, all the other items are fresh ingredients and readily available. You will need digital scales, proper measuring spoons to make sure the quantities are right. Most recipes are for two, just halve the ingredients or some meals can be frozen for another day. I’m not a big fan of red meat so the fish, chicken, food on the move and salads are perfect for me. I cook the casserole’s and roasts at the weekend for everyone. Absolutely brilliant book. After one week i’ve had comments on how well i look and shifted 5 lbs week one. I’m not particularly overweight but like everyone during lockdown gained a little weight, which i don’t like. I’ve tried all sorts of low carb diets and i’m quite controlled in the main, but usually get bored as i can’t think of things to eat. This book has solved the problem, the recipes are easy, quick, and taste fabulous. I honestly don’t feel like i’m missing out. There’s even a ‘speedy pizza’ which i feel like i’m having a real treat.

R2E0AQNC84MH68,"Excellent Recipes, excellent diet","I've never ever been able to stick at a diet due to my appalling discipline and a lack of ideas on what I could eat (I'm an extremely fussy eater with a terrifyingly extreme sweet tooth).  However, the meals in this book are exceptional and as a result I managed to stick at this one for a good 4 or 5 weeks, and then broadly stick to it in the 5:2 regime for another 7. The end result was that I lost 21.7kg / 48lbs / 3st 6lbs (depending on your weight format preference) in the 83 days between getting the book and writing this review.  So, it worked for me. Possibly saved my life, in fact. It may not work for you and I know that some people should absolutely not try this diet for health reasons as it is a little ""shock and awe"" in terms of how hard it is at times. But for those that are wavering over whether to give it a go, here's a bit of advice  - I found that once you get over the shocking hump (low energy, hunger etc) after a couple of weeks it's fairly easy thereafter, so do stick at it - It also helps if you properly count calories via a smart watch or app as it gives you objectives to hit - Get most of the cupboard essentials that it recommends in the back of the book. Absolutely invaluable. - Plan and shop for your full week of meals in advance. Know what you're having each day and have the ingredients in the house already. That a) gives you something to look forward to and b) removes the risk of panic-buying a microwave meal or takeaway or something else unhealthy if you feel you're in a rush or can't be bothered to cook. - The meals can take a little while to prep so make sure you give yourself the time to do it, but I really enjoyed learning new recipes and techniques, so I included this as part of the positive experience. - Fill yourself up on green veg with every meal. The portion sizes are obviously small but you really can load up with the ""free"" extras. It's healthy and it stops you being hungry - I've found that uncooked spinach (which I've never really liked before now) goes with most of the meals, for example.  As I said above, this was all made possible due to the quality of the recipes in this book - the tikka masala and all of the fish dishes in particular are genuinely and rather surprisingly outstanding - as they gave me something to look forward to rather than some pathetic, boring salad that would have got very dull after a day or two and helped me maintain the discipline that you have to have to get through the first few weeks (I didn't repeat a single recipe from the book in those first 21 days).  So, I hope other people have as much joy as I did with this book. It was a genuine, transformative, life changing experience.

R3FIR8MN7OTCU4,Definite Recommendation!,"I wanted to wait and see if this would help me to lose weight as I am a bit rubbish when it comes to willpower and I am a little fussy with what I can eat. I started on 6th June but it took a couple of weeks for me to properly start as I had to use up the food in the house that I already had. It's now 24th July and I have lost 10lbs which, for me, is pretty impressive. I also like a lot of the recipes as they are quick to make so lunches are easier to prepare when I have an hour to make it and eat it with time left to relax. The most important thing is that this teaches you where the calories come from and I feel like it's changed my lifestyle forever. I was worried the portions would leave me really hungry between meals but it's actually fine and if I need a bridge I just have a cup of coffee or herbal tea.  I seriously recommend this book, I've been telling all of my friends about it. It also saves you a small fortune on your grocery shop! For the rare times I don't feel like cooking I just have a slimfast shake so it's still on the diet theme. Eat your dinner early-ish and get that ketosis in motion overnight while you sleep. If I feel peckish after dinner I just chew some gum, it works a treat.  If you're serious about losing weight and often struggle please do try this book.

My 'But...' is because a) Not made clear that quantities often not for one person, so had to re-measure a lot b) Recipes look different but are often samey c) Best to buy the more exotic ingredients before you begin (they do advise this, but I missed that) as when you're into your initial 14 days you will be in no mood to hunt down hot paprika, smoked peppers etc etc.  Second review: I'm using it to lose weight post-Xmas, as it works a treat. The recipes do not leave you feeling hungry except on the third day. However... it is (in my view) essential to buy ALL the ingredients for EVERY reciped you'll be using before starting, except the fresh one's like broccoli. If you're working, whether at home or not, it's best to cook in advance and freeze, so each day the preparation is virtually nil. It's true the portion are for 2 or 4 sometimes and I'm just one. So... I cook them as listed and then freeze the resulting extra portions. Then I use these as substitutes as I go along, saving time and money. I also substitute ingredients (eg yoghurt fior creme fraiche) because otherwise I end up with something I won't use soon again. The two stars is because of the above and also too many of the recipes (as other reviews have noted) are either tasteless (the stews); need experience (anything with beans, do NOT buy standard cheap tins, go for Biona type in-water-only beans without the firming agent - much nicer); take too long to prepare; or are disgusting (cold breakfast porridge, fry up including broccili, yuk yuk). So 5 stars for a quick 14 day 3 meals a day weight loss method and education course in healthy eating but a miserable 2* for practicality, lask of clarity and taste.","<span>This is my second time round (using the 3 meals a day with meat option) and since I forgot to submit my first review two years ago I found it lurking here...<br><br>So, first review:<br>Bought with the Fast800 book.

R3QSXBLO9WCOEG,Makes losing weight easy,"I had lost a stone in less than four weeks on MM's Fast 800 diet, so I was keen to try more recipes from the more extensive range in this book. I am vegetarian, so many aren't suitable for me, though they can be tweaked by using low-carb meat substitutes.  I like this diet as the food and ingredients are not too outlandish or expensive, and meals can be batch-cooked (most mains are for four people) and frozen, which takes a lot of the nuisance out of preparing a meal for one person. It is also good to do a diet which has no restrictions on eating nuts, oil or full-fat milk!  Some of the recipes seem to have a rather high calorie count for someone on an 800-a-day regime so I guess you are meant to do a bit of recalibrating with your other meals.  The science of the Mosley/Bailey plan is very clear and it is actually quite a simple diet which consists of low-carb, low-sugar wholefoods.

If you want to prevent or reverse Type 2 diabetes, 'the 8 week blood sugar diet recipe book' in my opinion is the one to go for and the more important recipes are in both books (with some changes eg pear instead of apple). This Fast 800 recipe book uses too much fruit (including bananas and mango with ingredients which have too high sugar content for me - the breakfast section (not the brunch elements) are fruit or syrup ingredients based in the main. Recipes also include shakes (really!), maple syrup, honey, breads and pasta which are sugar and carb ingredients. The main meals are in the main pretty diabetic friendly and the treats sections speaks for itself.  Interestingly the nutritional content breakdown doesn't give you the sugar content at all and perhaps this should be traffic lighted as you see on food packaging. I found the book and recipes a little disappointing and misleading. Hence a 3 star - good elements and less good elements in my opinion .....

RHMJQ5W0TK61K,ITS A PRICKLY PROBLEM ...,"Book one of this much lauded YA Fantasy series is, to put it mildly, an extraordinary reading experience. It must be said, however, that ACOTAR starts off relatively slowly. The reader is introduced to the book’s principal character - Feyre - who is a huntress who kills for her own survival and that of her family. Her father is a broken man. Crippled, both physically, financially, and metaphorically. Her mother died when she was younger. He sisters are two unloving, and facetious twats. Her brothers are something our heroine (and the story) were not blessed with.  Fate brings Fayre and a beautiful, fully grown wolf together in the sunlight dappled reaches of the nearby Forest. Destiny steps forth to convince Fayre to kill the wolf. She does so, and her life is never the same again. For the wolf she killed was anything but. Fayre is captured for the kill and punishment is either instant death, or lifelong banishment into the enemy’s kingdom. She chooses the latter to save her family, and this is where the book’s true nature takes form and steals the reader’s heart.  For this is where we meet Tamlin, and Lucien. The sworn and hated enemies who aren’t. It is easy to detest them both, but read on, and your feelings toward them will soften. Moments of breathtaking excitement and beauty follow. Chapter after chapter, after chapter, feature cliffhangers and profound plot twists, that quite literally, take your breath away, and make it impossible for the reader to put the book down. A chain of truly stupendous OMG moments leave the reader in tatters when they realise they must put the book down eventually to rejoin society. Chapter thirteen is where the book finds it’s street cred from a fantasy perspective. And chapter eighteen is a good way for the reader to determine if they are still human, and if they still have a heart than can be broken.  This book is structured, and written beautifully. Pacing is perfect, too. A harsh critic would give it four stars and say, 'its only book one of a trilogy, and you need to leave room for improvement...’ Well, I ain’t no harsh critic. This book is worth full marks, and if the rest are even better, then no doubt the world will get to hear of it. ACOTAR is the first Sarah J Maas book that i have picked up and it is truly gorgeous in just about every way imaginable. My good fortune lies in the fact that book two is less than three months away. That gives me time to read this one again (and again, and again) in readiness, or go and purchase the other titles in her world wide best selling catalog.  Either way, I can’t lose.

R1O29TI7R8VYX2,Definitely getting the rest of the series,"Definitely an enjoyable read that I'll be recommending to my other book loving friends.  The first half of the book I'd rate 3/5, it's a little bit slow but not in a boring way. We learn about Feyre and what a strong female lead she is, the sacrifices she has to make for her family and also about the layout of the faerie court. Great world and character building, it makes the reader feel like this is mostly a love story about overcoming difficultiws together. However, once the plot twist hits it seems more of an action/adventure and really picks up the pace.  All of the characters are likeable I'd say minus Feyre's family who really invoke frustration and anger from the reader. The main love interest isn't really that interesting in my opinion but it could be because he was only one of the many aspects of the book that drove feyre's motivation. And he may build a lot more depth in character in the next books in the series.  I still kept thinking about the book even the next day after I'd finished it which is always a positive sign for me. I'll definitely be reading the rest of the series in the near future.  Though I feel like the first book itself tied up many loose ends where if someone wanted to they could definitely just stop after the first book.","<span>Definitely an enjoyable read that I'll be recommending to my other book loving friends.<br><br>The first half of the book I'd rate 3/5, it's a little bit slow but not in a boring way.

RGN766INW2NW3,Slow start but has potential,"‘A Court of Thorns and Roses’ is book one in Sarah J. Maas’ A Court of Thorns and Roses series.  Feyre with her two older sisters Nesta & Elain along with their father live in a small human town that borders the wall between humans and Fae. Five hundred years ago a War broke out between Humans and Fae, which resulted in Humans living in the South of Prythian in the Mortal Lands, and the Wall built. While out Hunter Feyre kills a Fae in the form of a Wolf which results in her coming face to face with the very beings her kind have been brought up to fear.  This was a bit of a slow start, but by the 70% mark I was completely invested. I did find Feyre to be a tad naive and easily manipulated. Her family literally treated her like crap all her life, and the promise she had made I found to be utter bull. Dont get me wrong I understand that without her, her family wouldn’t not have survived as long as they had, but how is that fair to her. Feyre is strong in her own unique way, learning everything by herself makes her a stronger person. Feyre has been dealt a rare hand in this story, starving, living in poverty, living with her enemies, and so much more. Than when she is finally “happy” things go down hill even more.  I do not like Tamlin, I find him to be too secretive, manipulative, and there is something about him that just irks me. Even when things started to heat up between him and Feyre I still felt as if this was all wrong. Yes he helps her come into herself and helps her get over her “promise” but there is more behind him. Plus in what world is it ok to not want to help the one you love when they are in danger. Plus the first chance he gets when Under the Mountain to help he wants to hump away instead of escaping. Nope not ok.  Now Rhysand, well he is a different matter. I LOVE RHYSAND. Just putting it out there, I have a thing for the bad boy, he intrigues me. But there is something else under his mask that he puts out to everyone. From the moment he first meets Feyre on the hill he has done one thing after another to help her. Under the Mountain is where I really fell for him, he’s constant helping Feyre out even though it would cost him. His flirtatious banter with Feyre had me smiling and blushing.  I am hoping that like Ms Maas’ TOG series that the misunderstood, grouchy, moody, male is the love interest and not the first male as I can not stand Tamlin.  This series has serious potential and I can’t wait to see how things turn out. I off now to go and read book two.","<span>‘A Court of Thorns and Roses’ is book one in Sarah J.

R1297A38LYZ0IS,I’m glad I gave it a second chance,"I originally attempted to read this book a couple of years ago and stopped reading at 66%. At the time I did not know it was a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, and so the similarities turned me off quite a bit back then, as it seemed unoriginal. However, I decided to give ACOTR another go, considering how everyone raves about this series and I’ve heard that the first book isn’t so great compared to the rest. So here I am giving it a second chance.  I again am annoyed at how awful Feyre’s family is at the beginning of the book. The interactions and description of the family dynamic can be summed up as childish, more like a Cinderella vibe with her two selfish and egotistical sisters. It just doesn’t seem realistic and is cringe worthy when reading. It makes is look like Feyre is an enabler for letting her family be lazy and for letting them get away with their juvenile behaviour.

I actually did like the part of Feyre living in the fae world and getting to know Tamlin and Lucien. As another review states, I was wary of Tamlin. He’s polite but then always seems to be snarling at her. I’m suss about his motives. I knew to be on the watch for Rhysand and at the beginning he has kind of Damon from Vampire Diaries vibes.

At the time I did not know it was a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, and so the similarities turned me off quite a bit back then, as it seemed unoriginal. However, I decided to give ACOTR another go, considering how everyone raves about this series and I’ve heard that the first book isn’t so great compared to the rest.

No way u call a dude most handsome and still stay with the beginning guy. Tragic. Truly, truly tragic. It’s not even that I object to her having another love interest - it’s that the main couple barely got a chance to really start loving each other in such a beautiful way outside of having to kill people to be together before the author introduces the new love interest (who, cough, does some NOT OKAY things to her aka lowkey sexually assaults her and TWISTS HER EXPOSED BONE TO MANIPULATE HER DECISIONS like bro.) and yeah I’m sure he redeems himself in the next book within 1 chapter.

R2PQAFS9A11EMC,Second Time Round and Still Delivers,"This was my second time reading A Court of Thorns and Roses. And what an epic adventure of magic, love, torture and darkness. Sarah J. Maas has delivered a unique retelling of Beauty and the Beast that stretches far past the classic tale. Feyre has taken to venturing further and further into the forest, closer to the wall that separates the faeries and their magic from the land of the humans. But when Feyre takes the life of a fae she has to pay the price. Having to leave her father, her sisters and the life she has known behind, Feyre is taken beyond the wall and into a world where nothing is as it seems. What happens when the good versus evil is not what you thought it was and the fae you had been taught to fear were not necessarily the evil they had been made out to be. Humans versus Fae turns into life and love versus greed and death in this epic tale. For those that prefer to not enter into a long trilogy, A Court of Thorns and Roses could be read as a standalone novel, however could not wait to get into the second book in this great series.","<span>This was my second time reading A Court of Thorns and Roses.

R3SLKRVLXSG2L1,ALL THE STARS!!!!,"ALL THE STARS!!!!!!!!!  Okay, this review is split into two sections: 1. General gushing about how awesome this book is in very general terms 2. A clearly marked spoiler section where I list the things I love and make some guesses for the next book. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!  Section 1: A Court of Mist and Fury is my favourite book by Sarah J. Maas EVER! HoF was my ultimate before, and ACOMAF is like HoF, but even more emotionally intense. I've just turned the last page and I want to flip back to the start and take the crazy journey all over again. Feyre - I cried when she broke, her sadness and sorrow. I smiled when she began to heal. I laughed when she began cracking jokes with... I don't want to spoil it, but *wink* (those who have read it will know) Tamlin and Rhys - I adore the development of these two. Everything is explained and I am so on board with what is happening emotionally for Feyre. The new characters - I love them so much! Don't want to spoil anything, but what an awesome (and feral!) gang. The locations - Sorry I'm being so vague, but I don't want any spoilers. Just, when Feyre goes to the Night Court for that week plus the other locations... so beautiful and lovely. The plot - I LOVED EVERY PAGE!!! ACOMAF doesn't slow down for a single moment, no slow start like ACOTAR. Your minds will be blown people. Yeah, so I'm already desperate for the next book, but I also don't mind the wait - I'll enjoy re-reading ACOMAF a few times during the next year :)  SPOILER SECTION!!!!!! .............. ............ .......... ..... .. .  Okay everyone. ACOMAF was so awesome and what I loved most is listed below: Rhys and Feyre mating bond: Yes people, just yes to this. We all suspected, but I didn't know how Sarah was going to do it, after everything that happened in ACOTAR, but I am completely satisfied and the profound nature of the mating bond completely wipes the slate clean for me. Tamlin and Feyre were just never going to work. Also, how could Tamlin lock Feyre away like that? I really like that Sarah has depicted the difference between an abusive relationship and a protective, but true love and trust relationship. Plot: So many wonderful points - When Rhys saves Feyre from the wedding, the awesome times at the Night Court, when Rhys saved Feyre (sort of??) again from being locked away in the mansion, discovering Veradis, the huge scene when we meet the Inner Circle (Amren - epic times ahead people), The Weaver scene was awesome, Starfall was completely beautiful, the battle for Veradis (Feyre was AMAZING!!!), of course, the moment when Feyre found out about the mating bond, Rhys explaining everything and then the ending - IT DID INDEED BREAK MY HEART. Also, I though ACOTAR was steamy - ACOMAF is like, steamy to the power of infinity. Prepare for steamy moments - you have been warned.  Look, I just loved everything about this book - feel free to message me if you want to gush about it.  So, to some predictions: Title: Ugh, A Court of...... I actually have no idea. Something might come to me soon. Cover: Mmmm, red and blue have been done, soooo, purple? Yeah, I really want a purple cover. Plot Points: *Well, Rhys and Feyre getting back together, obviously (that will be the best reunion EVER) *Feyre being very sneaky *Lucien helping Feyre be very sneaky. *Lucien and Elain talking about the mating bond *Feyre being forced to have sexytimes with Tamlin (this makes me sad, but I think it will happen) *Amren being awesome (along with Cassien, Azriel and Mor, of course) *Tamlin becoming even more unhinged - seriously people, what happened to him? *An amazing final battle. *Nestra and Cassien having a mating bond (or Nestra finding a mate, one of the other) *Feyre and Rhys returning home to Veradis and being the best and most powerful rulers ever.

R128SSC9UN8PP8,Wow - what a story!,"I had this book in my reading list for a while but wasn't sure because there are so many books - but my sister convinced me that I'll want to read all of them. I know some are not yet written and so far I have not been disappointed. It is SO hard to put the books down. I wasn't prepared for the twist in this book, and I'm not disappointed. So in love with Feyre and her 'family'. I won't spoil it for anyone. There is so much thought and depth to these books. To the emotion and the psychology behind how different people deal with hardships and their past in different ways. How the villain and the hero isn't always so clear, that there's more under the surface. So good! Can't wait to see what the third book brings with Feyre and her gifts.","<span>I had this book in my reading list for a while but wasn't sure because there are so many books - but my sister convinced me that I'll want to read all of them.

R2R62KP77A176Q,You are in for an emotional roller coaster,"‘A Court of Mist and Fury’ is book two in Sarah J. Maas’ A Court of Thorns and Roses series. Reading previous book is required before this. This ends on a cliffhanger that will cause you to rage and scream.  After defeating Amarntha’s trials to free Tamlin and the Spring Court, dying being turned into a Fae, Feyre finds herself in a very dark emotional place. A High Lord fiancé who doesn’t understand what is going on inside her, a Court that whispers and stares at her and a bargain with the High Lord of Night Court to deal with. Feyre is struggling with what it means to be High Fae, trying to come to terms with killing innocent Fae and what she had to endure while Under the Mountain.  I’m just going to start off by saying I HATE TAMLIN! I called it, if you’ve read my review for ACOTAR you would know that I said that I dislikes Tamlin and wanted Rhys to be the love interest. I knew that Tamlin was a manipulative d!ck, but I did not see how far he was willing to go to prove that.  Holy freaking hell, so, so, so much happens in this book. I have absolutely no idea where to start or what to write. I am utterly and completely speechless. I still reeling from all the events that took place. On one hand I want to write about each and everything that took place, but than on the other hand I don’t want to write one things about it as it will spoil your experience and well as ruin the journey you will take if you read this. So I will say this, buckle in cause you are in for one heck of a roller coaster ride. The emotions you are about to undergo will leave you completely exhausted, you’ll go from happiness to anger and back, you’ll be shocked, awestruck, flabbergasted, surprised and absolutely furious. But it’s a ride you are going to want to go on.  My heart broke on several occasions in this book, the emotions that poured off these pages were so raw and powerful. I felt each and everyone of them to my very core.  Feyre’s character has some major growth in this book, I feel as if when she become Fae she became her true self. Although there was times I still felt that she was too much of a push over and easily manipulated. I did not like how she first reacted with Rhys, she never seemed to give him a chance. Yes she says she’s in love with Tamlin, but considering he kidnapped her in ACOTAR she never treated him the way she does Rhys when he comes for the bargain. Plus he is only trying to help her.  Rhysand, oh you sexy, sweet, misunderstood self sacrificing Fae male. I knew you would be the one to break me, but I had no idea how much you would. You took a part of my heart in ACOTAR but now you just own it whole and completely. You may plan the evil, sadistic heartless High Lord, “But I see you”.  The Kingdom of Dreams is perfect, the members Mor, Cassian, Azriel, Amren. The banter and family closeness of this group will having you wishing you could jump into the book and be one of them. Their disregard to the rules of formality was hilarious. They treated each other as if they were all family, the bickering, teasing, mocking and playfulness is an enjoyable sight to see.  I don’t know where to start with the Spring Court, but I hope you all go down in a fiery ball of hell. Except for one particular handmaiden and nephews, she may be left alone. This court are so manipulative and full of lies and deceit.  I may have gone off track with this review and started rambling, so I am going to end it here and just say one finally thing, go and get this series and read it NOW. Yes this may only be book two and there is still a few more, but after what I have read and experienced so far I can tell this is going to be a series to remember for a long while. With that being said I am off to read book three, I desperately need to know what kind of trouble Feyre is about to ran on Tamlin and his Court.","<span>‘A Court of Mist and Fury’ is book two in Sarah J.

Only thing I would add, I believe more showing of these characters quirks than telling would be more beneficial. Fey, I only liked a little at the beginning. Rhysand is stunning, though a few characteristics are watery, he softens too much, too fast. I would have liked he fight a little more with fey, that he bit back harder and carried his scars clearer. That he was a little more, relatable. In this, he is by far my favourite character.  I feel the book lacked a lot of subtle details and certain depths that would have put the reader in the characters shoes better. There was too much of back logging thoughts, of the past, at times it became tiresome. Dialog was good, settings... could have been clearer, Some pages I had to re read to understand what was going on for bits were missed. (The writer knows her picture, what she wants to portray, sometimes this isn’t shown clear as it could be.) In saying this, this is my personal opinion and as a writer I have a far more sceptical view of other authors. Over all, a stunning book that ascends about many others of it’s kind. Highly recommend read.","<span>Sarah has an incredible mind that I relate too.<br>The plot is well written, characters are deep and interesting.

R2PLFROMN0UCCR,Second time reading and even better than before!,"Second time reading it and if it is even possible, I love this book more than the first. This book is as much about being an epic romance as it is with being about how one deals with guilt and trauma.

After Feyre swaps the Spring Court for the Night Court, things begin to really get interesting and much of what the first book hinted at becomes clear. The new characters introduced bring a warmer side to the story, even if they all have their own sob stories, and we see lover turn to enemy and… enemy turn to lover? Hmm, have to read it yourself. However, who could not love a bad boy and Rhysand certainly appears to be just that. Sarah J. Maas has a habit of revealing major plot developments after they have happened, you literally find out what has happened with the main characters when the other characters do, but this adds a touch of surprise that’ll keep you on the edge of your seat as you turn the pages. The ending of A Court of Mist and Fury is, well I hate to say it, but, it’s painful. Painful because it is so good. Sarah J.

R38DOTT4VW4CG0,Everything I was hoping for!,"I love this author and after reading the Throne of Glass series I couldn't wait to tackle this new series. With this second book, I finally have what I was looking forward to and expecting from Sarah all along. The first book just felt a little off, maybe a little flat. It was pleasant and easy to read, just not quite what I had come to know from this author. But I'm so happy I stuck it out. This book was soooo much better. And I think it's all down to her main characters differing relationships between the two novels. You can feel the wrongness in the first throughout the first book and maybe that's what just felt a bit off but this book had flow and connection, more of a richness. I also love the depth we get to see of the faerie worlds and the characters within them, as well as the backstory of more of their courts too.

It felt like the authors had just googled Stoicism, or only just read Frankls 'Mans search for meaning', and added in their own paraphrased version sections of the book. At times it felt like a student's essay who was not quite an expert of the topic.

R3SSB0GYFQRVN2,The title is misleading.,"I think the book is wrongly named. It should be called “The lives and times of the people of Okinawa and a mix of other bits and pieces of philosophies”. I’m still confused about what this book is actually about. It definitely doesn’t provide much help to find YOUR Ikigai as the subtitles suggest, unless that goal is just to grow old. The short passages about the lives of the people in the village of Ogimi in Okinawa are lovely and do touch on the inhabitants sense of Ikigai. However, this book is more a series of random observations and quotes that I could find in Google. It spends a lot of time describing the virtues of living a long life but then has snippets of various philosophies extolling the virtues of living in the here and now. I think the authors had little to write about and just rambled. The cynic in me suggests they found a good title and some buzz words and hoped it would be a best seller. And we all fell for it.

RN8TPIGQFK9Q3,Time for the Lord and Lady of Shadow to rise,"‘A Court of Frost and Starlight’ is book four in Sarah J. Maas’ A Court of Thorns and Roses series. Reading previous books is required before this. Told in multiple POVs by Feyre, Rhysand, Cassian, Mor, and Nesta.  With the Hybern King and his army now defeated, the High Lords must now start to rebuild their Courts. Rhysand and Feyre as the High Lord and Lady of the Night Court their priorities for their people have them struggling to spend time together. With the Winter Solstice coming up, Feyre feels guilty to be celebrating when so many people are having a hard time after the war. But the Winter Solstice celebration is just what the Kingdom of Dreams need.  A wonderful ending for Feyre and Rhysand’s tales. These two have gone through so much in such a short while, there haven’t been perfect moments for them, but it has made them stronger none the less.  Again I am at a lost as to what to put in this review, the only thing that comes to mind is to say that you will not be disappointed when reading this book or series. I do feel like I am a little lost now that we have finished with Frysand’s books, yes I know that their story will continue on in ACOSF but as that is told in Nesta’s POV I am not really looking forward to it. I know it will have some POV’s from Cassian and this is where I feel terrible, but I am not a fan whatsoever of Nesta.  This some what of an ending was wonderfully written and to see Feyre finally being happy made the journey of reading these books filled with heartache all worth it. A quick little read to give us the readers a little inside into what out Kingdom of Dreamers are up to now that the King of Hybern is no more.  Though the war is over the clean up, alliances and rebuilding isn’t over. Be prepared to have you heart broken when getting inside certain characters heads and seeing how they are dealing with the after effects. Some are going to crush you, others will surprise you and like me a certain someone is going to irritate and frustrate you.  The only thing I will mention that I did not like was Nesta’s attitude. Again she treats Feyre like she is the evil incarnate and that everything that has gone wrong is her doing, and that the situation that she has put herself in is everyone else’s fault and not hers.  I was surprised but Elain’s character, she has done some growth since the previous books, she is as much of a naive mouse like the before. She has come into her ways and for the better.  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU SJM for creating this world and especially the characters that fill the pages. I felt like I was apart of it and loved getting to know each character.","<span>‘A Court of Frost and Starlight’ is book four in Sarah J. Maas’ A Court of Thorns and Roses series. Reading previous books is required before this. Told in multiple POVs by Feyre, Rhysand, Cassian, Mor, and Nesta.<br><br>With the Hybern King and his army now defeated, the High Lords must now start to rebuild their Courts. Rhysand and Feyre as the High Lord and Lady of the Night Court their priorities for their people have them struggling to spend time together. With the Winter Solstice coming up, Feyre feels guilty to be celebrating when so many people are having a hard time after the war. But the Winter Solstice celebration is just what the Kingdom of Dreams need.<br><br>A wonderful ending for Feyre and Rhysand’s tales. These two have gone through so much in such a short while, there haven’t been perfect moments for them, but it has made them stronger none the less.<br><br>Again I am at a lost as to what to put in this review, the only thing that comes to mind is to say that you will not be disappointed when reading this book or series. I do feel like I am a little lost now that we have finished with Frysand’s books, yes I know that their story will continue on in ACOSF but as that is told in Nesta’s POV I am not really looking forward to it. I know it will have some POV’s from Cassian and this is where I feel terrible, but I am not a fan whatsoever of Nesta.<br><br>This some what of an ending was wonderfully written and to see Feyre finally being happy made the journey of reading these books filled with heartache all worth it. A quick little read to give us the readers a little inside into what out Kingdom of Dreamers are up to now that the King of Hybern is no more.<br><br>Though the war is over the clean up, alliances and rebuilding isn’t over. Be prepared to have you heart broken when getting inside certain characters heads and seeing how they are dealing with the after effects. Some are going to crush you, others will surprise you and like me a certain someone is going to irritate and frustrate you.<br><br>The only thing I will mention that I did not like was Nesta’s attitude.

R2F4GMBJ1ZT9ML,Not neccessary,"This was more of a slice of life or filler book in my opinion. I think it would've been better if this was added onto the start of A court of Silver Flames rather than a stand alone book.  Honestly after the epic ending that was a Court of Wings and Ruin this was rather... boring. It reminded me a lot of when TV shows have ""Christmas Special Episodes"" where we see how characters celebrate holidays. In this book they are celebrating the Winter Solstice which might as well be Christmas.  Not too much happens in this book that is rather significant... Nesta is still angry at the world, Elaine is still ignoring Lucian... Feyre is learning to love her hobbies again. There is some talk regarding the aftermath of the war but I don't feel like this was worth being a standalone book imo.","<span>This was more of a slice of life or filler book in my opinion.

R3B6K5I8KDKTTP,A Court of Frost and Starlight,"This was a very touching and heartwarming holiday novella. After reading all of the excitement and action in the preceding three books, it was simply a breath of fresh air. I thoroughly enjoyed reading all of the different points of view, therefore seeing how the other characters see the world.

Certain characters, particularly Feyre, are starting to become slightly unpleasant and tiresome to read about. I am growing tired of this series and find it less fascinating than it used to be.

The way he acts around Nesta annoys me but I am interested to see how their dynamic pans out. I also want to delve more into his backstory. 3. It was so easy to slip back into the world. From the first sentence, I was already immersed in the world Sarah J. Maas has created. 4. It was nice to see Feyre and Rhys again but I am over their story. At least I was in this book. It was a lot of smut which made me gag to be honest. 5. Going to be blunt here, nothing actually happened. This was like an extended epilogue where maybe the last two chapters actually matter for the next set of books in this world. The rest of it was basically a bundle of happy emotions as we got to see the gang and see where everyone is and what everyone is doing. 6. I didn't like the switch between first and third person. It was really jarring. Also the voices of Feyre and Rhys were not as distinct as they usually are. Probably, because all they do is fawn over each other, so you're just reading the same thoughts from both of them over and over and over again.

R3QJ8RHV66667C,Abby Jimenez delivers with another 5 star read!,"I waited in eager anticipation for this book, and it didn’t disappoint - I adored Just for the Summer. In true Abby Jimenez style it is full of beautifully nuanced relationships, witty banter, cute animals; balanced with sensitive exploration of some really difficult situations.  Emma meets Justin via a reddit post - they share a common curse. All of their exes go on to meet their one true love immediately after breaking up. Logic dictates therefore, that if they date each other, they will break the curse, and each meet their own true love. Embarking on a quick fling becomes much more complicated, when Emma’s toxic mother shows up, and Justin has to take on care of his siblings.  Whilst this makes for a great meet cute, Emma and Justin’s story is much more. I thought Jimenez did a beautiful job of exploring the enduring impact that trauma and abandonment can have on relationships. I loved Emma and Justin’s chemistry, relationship development, and the way they taught each other to heal and thrive. I'm hesitant to share much more, as I found so much joy in the twists and turns of this book. I had a great time losing myself in this story. It was the perfect blend of romantic, fun, poignant, heartfelt, witty, and silly.  True of her other books, there were so many easter eggs and cameos! This is a great book as standalone, but I would highly recommend reading Part of Your World and Yours Truly first for an even more enjoyable experience.  Thank you Little, Brown Book Group UK and NetGalley for a complimentary copy of this book.

This one brought a lot more tears though, what a book! 🥹  As always a book by Abby is more than just a romance story, each character is going through a life altering situation, and trying to navigate that.

Emma’s 🧡 story is heartbreaking, and I’ve said it before but she’s a better person than I am, because it takes a lot to be that compassionate towards the people that hurt you the most.

And how he showed up for Emma too?? I was in love with him.  This is the book to not only make you sob 😭 but also make you laugh and giggle a whole lot. These two characters had BANTER!!!! The side characters (like Maddy and Brad -dog and person) brought so much light and life to the story!  Also, we get a little appearance by Jacob and Brianna (Yours Truly), and MY GOD 🤯 do we get to see Daniel and Alexis (Part Of Your World).

R2XLQSZ0EBMNIP,They just keep getting better,"This book is emotional, heartbreaking, and wonderful. I just adore reading books by this author. After finishing this one, I am eager to revisit ""Part of Your World."" However, it's important to note that this book contains many triggers, so I suggest checking out what some of those triggers are before diving in. Emma ended up in foster care as a child but was ultimately fortunate to find herself in a supportive foster home that adored her and wanted to adopt her. However, Emma wasn’t ready to give up on her mother and didn’t want to be adopted. Emma and her best friend Maddy, both nurses, travel around taking different work assignments all over the country. They usually stay in one place for three months and seek out interesting places to stay. On a whim, Emma and Maddy decide to comment on a post by Justin on Reddit, leading to an exchange of banter between Emma and Justin. This interaction makes Emma consider traveling to Minnesota for the summer to see if they can break their mutual curse of dating people only to find out the last person they dated found their soulmate.  The storyline is entertaining but also explores the difficult topics of trauma from being abandoned as a child and striving to live a full life despite it.  Having had a difficult childhood myself, I could really relate to Emma's desire to be small and invisible. I thought this was portrayed in a very authentic manner.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can’t wait for my copy to arrive, as this book is definitely a keeper.

However, it's important to note that this book contains many triggers, so I suggest checking out what some of those triggers are before diving in.<br>Emma ended up in foster care as a child but was ultimately fortunate to find herself in a supportive foster home that adored her and wanted to adopt her. However, Emma wasn’t ready to give up on her mother and didn’t want to be adopted. Emma and her best friend Maddy, both nurses, travel around taking different work assignments all over the country. They usually stay in one place for three months and seek out interesting places to stay. On a whim, Emma and Maddy decide to comment on a post by Justin on Reddit, leading to an exchange of banter between Emma and Justin. This interaction makes Emma consider traveling to Minnesota for the summer to see if they can break their mutual curse of dating people only to find out the last person they dated found their soulmate.<br><br>The storyline is entertaining but also explores the difficult topics of trauma from being abandoned as a child and striving to live a full life despite it.<br><br>Having had a difficult childhood myself, I could really relate to Emma's desire to be small and invisible. I thought this was portrayed in a very authentic manner.<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can’t wait for my copy to arrive, as this book is definitely a keeper.

R2Z7BXQF2CPJW4,Oh my gosh! The EMOTIONS!!!,"When I saw that Abby Jimenez had a new 2024 release, I was excited to read it. I enjoyed Yours Truly, her previous release. It ended up on my favourite lists recently, so I had high expectations for Just For The Summer. For me, Abby Jimenez is an expert at the quiet, realistic romances. When I read her books, I believe the characters could actually exist in the world. Her books also tend to pull on real-world emotions and experiences, which make her stories extremely impactful. As a result, I expected a similar reading experience with Just for the Summer, and I was not disappointed. The strongest aspect of Just for the Summer would have to be the characters. Both the main protagonists and the side characters are well-developed, interesting, and realistic. While there are some plot-driven elements to the story, such as the short time frame that Emma and Justin have together, it is their characters that truly drive the story.  Emma was one of my favourite female protagonists that I have read recently. She was a well-thought out character with a strong character arc who shows a lot of growth from beginning to end. Emma lacks a strong emotional attachment to those around her due to her mother’s narcissistic and absent nature during her childhood. As a result, Emma doesn’t always make the “likeable” decision, but she always makes a decision true to her character. Justin is also a strong character with a developed backstory. After his father’s death, Justin’s mother commits a crime and is sentenced to six years in prison. Consequently, he must take over a parental role with his three younger siblings. Justin is the kind of character that I love to see as a romantic interest. He was stable, sweet, and respectful of Emma. However, he also was clear with what he wanted in a relationship with Emma and was honest when her actions affected him negatively. The side characters, particularly Emma’s mother, were also well-developed. Emma’s mother, Amber, was not a likeable person whatsoever, but she was incredibly realistic. I think Jimenez did an excellent job of making her the “villain,” but not cartoon-ish. It was also interesting to see characters from previous novels, such as Neil, and what happened to his character after Part of Your World. Another aspect that I enjoyed was the romance. As I mentioned previously, Jimenez does a great job with quiet, realistic romances. Sometimes, it feels like characters are thrown together simply because they are the main characters in a romance novel, but that isn’t the case in this book. Emma and Justin challenge each other’s ideas about life and love. They are exactly what the other person needed out of a relationship. Emma taught Justin to be more empathetic, and Justin taught Emma that there would be people who would stick beside her, no matter what.  Finally, I loved this book of the strong emotional connection that I had to this novel. Like I mentioned earlier, Jimenez always pulls on real-world feelings and emotions that make her stories more impactful. Just for the Summer was no exception. I found myself crying multiple times throughout the story because of how Emma’s story was so heartbreaking and realistic, but also how beautiful and hopeful it was.  Final Thoughts  Overall, I loved this story. Abby Jimenez is quickly becoming an auto-buy author for me. I give this book five out of five stars.","<span>When I saw that Abby Jimenez had a new 2024 release, I was excited to read it. I enjoyed Yours Truly, her previous release.

R1JW4GF17AKIEY,A heartbreaking but ultimately uplifting story of love and found family.,"REVIEW cw: panic attacks, anxiety, PTSD, depression, grief, undiagnosed mental health issues, toxic parenting, past child neglect Emma and Justin have something in common: they're always the person someone dates right before they find The One. When Emma reads Justin's viral Reddit AITA thread, an idea is formed. What if they dated each other? Maybe they'd finally break their respective curses, and then find their own true loves. Abby Jimenez always puts my emotions through the wringer, in the best possible way. She also writes the softest book boyfriends, and Justin immediately stole my heart. He was such a cinnamon roll, hilariously funny but also self-deprecating. I loved the graphics and questionnaires he sent to Emma, and his nervousness on the first date was so adorable. And honestly? Best. First. Date. EVER. Also? If a man wouldn't come to my rescue on a rainbow unicorn floatie, I don’t want him! I loved how much he cared about the people around him, and I found chapter thirty-two profoundly beautiful. Meanwhile, chapter nineteen made me laugh and cry in equal measure. The raccoon situation was too funny. But chapter twenty-one? I bawled. I loved that Justin was so transparent about his feelings, despite his own emotional baggage. He was SUCH a good man. And that birthday gift? Utter perfection. I adored Justin's friends. I loved that Benny (yes, THAT Benny) and Brad were so supportive of Justin. The whole Brad situation was hilarious. Faith's constant exasperation with Justin's dog's name was amusing. But more than that, both Benny and Brad were sweethearts, and I loved how much they cared about Justin and his family. Speaking of supporting characters, I loved all of the friendships in this book. Maddy was hilarious. Her vetting of Justin was peak friendship, and all of her dating theories were hilariously brilliant. But I also felt her frustration with Emma and how she continually gave her mum (Amber) a pass. I appreciated that she made sure to point out how Amber was so neglectful of Emma, and I could feel her hurt at times. But she was also THE most loyal, supportive friend and I loved how much she cared about Emma, and rooted for her relationship with Justin, as well as helping him understand Emma's trauma. I went on quite a journey with my feelings for Emma. I was simultaneously heartbroken for and frustrated with her for quite some time. On one hand, I couldn't even begin to imagine how difficult her childhood must have been. Her resilience was commendable, and while I empathised with her, and in many ways could understand her blind hope in her mother, her resistance to what was glaringly obvious at times frustrated me, especially surrounding Amber's behaviour. Still, I'm glad Emma finally opened herself up to love and stability, and I adored how natural she was with Justin's siblings, even when she was struggling. I loved the metaphors with the rose bush and the island. And that twist! It completely reframed my feelings about Emma, and I finished the story loving her. There were some amazing little Easter eggs from other Abby books. Amber's new boyfriend SHOOK ME, and as for what happened in chapter forty? (no spoilers, but OMG. I was screaming, but also SO angry on Emma's behalf). That chapter absolutely BROKE me, and I'm still not over it. I also loved that Abby didn't take the easy option afterwards, even though I sobbed for most of the rest of the book. Thankfully, she always guarantees a HEA, and this one was perfect, so even though i was emotionally drained by the end, I was also intensely happy. A heartbreaking but ultimately uplifting story of love and found family. Stock up on tissues!

RSCCA95AMRRTO,"""Always choose empathy""","""The best kind of love doesn't happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life.”  Another fabulous, unique, slowburn RomCom from Abby Jimenez set at a summer cottage on the lake, full of insightful depth and emotions and just the right amount of spice!  I’m a huge fan of Abby’s writing style and how well she develops her characters in all her books. This book was no different. Emma, the FMC, has a fear of long term commitment due to childhood trauma. Her character wasn’t easy to connect with at the beginning but I feel like it was written this way to show how hard it was for her to connect and trust people. As the story unfolds it is easier to understand why the traveling nurse is slow to trust and has a fear of long term commitments. I loved Emma’s best friend Maddy and her no nonsense, overprotective but hilarious personality. Then there’s Justin…a perfect selfless gentleman/boyfriend who isn’t afraid of a commitment, no matter the cost. He is resilient and always puts everyone else’s needs before his own.  I appreciate that Abby isn’t afraid to include the topic of mental health and trauma in her books.

This book was no different. Emma, the FMC, has a fear of long term commitment due to childhood trauma. Her character wasn’t easy to connect with at the beginning but I feel like it was written this way to show how hard it was for her to connect and trust people. As the story unfolds it is easier to understand why the traveling nurse is slow to trust and has a fear of long term commitments. I loved Emma’s best friend Maddy and her no nonsense, overprotective but hilarious personality. Then there’s Justin…a perfect selfless gentleman/boyfriend who isn’t afraid of a commitment, no matter the cost. He is resilient and always puts everyone else’s needs before his own.<br><br>I appreciate that Abby isn’t afraid to include the topic of mental health and trauma in her books.

R3BTBC7OWAQM2V,Captivating Characters and Seamless Storytelling: A Review of 'Just for the Summer' by Abby Jimenez,"""Just for the Summer"" by Abby Jimenez captivated me from start to finish, earning its place as one of the best stories I've ever read. Emma and Justin's characters were so compelling, which is rare for me as I don't easily connect with heroines in books. Their struggles were portrayed with such depth that it added a wonderful layer of conflict to the narrative.  I particularly enjoyed the incorporation of the Reddit post, which added a hilarious and authentic touch. The recurring question of ""Am I the A-hole?"" provided a delightful comic element throughout the story. Jimenez's storytelling prowess truly shines here, seamlessly blending humor with moments that evoked genuine tears from me.  What struck me most was the seamless connection to the first book, ""Part of Your World."" It prompted me to revisit the earlier story, realizing how much I had forgotten. Upon rereading both books, I found myself even more enamored with ""Just for the Summer.""  Our international book club had a riveting discussion about the characters, particularly Amber, whose complexity led us to ponder whether she was a narcissist, bipolar, or a blend of both. The depth and believability of the characters sparked conversations as if they were real individuals rather than fictional creations.  Experiencing the book through both Kindle and Audible, narrated by Christine Lakin and Zachary Weber, was a treat. Both narrators brought the story to life with their exceptional talent, enhancing the overall experience.  I wholeheartedly recommend any book penned by Abby Jimenez. Her storytelling prowess and ability to craft multidimensional characters make her a must-read author for me.","<span>""Just for the Summer"" by Abby Jimenez captivated me from start to finish, earning its place as one of the best stories I've ever read.

RCGSGFRS9OJR8,Abby never disappoints!,"I loooooved this book and it may be my favourite Abby Jimenez book yet. I really enjoy that all the books are connected (especially this one) and it’s really rewarding following all the characters and getting updates. Justin is one of the first book boyfriends to give me butterflies in a long time and Emma was a very complex female character dealing with real issues that she has to work through before getting her happily ever after. One of the things that makes me love Jimenez’s writing is how she deals with real life, complicated issues that the average person also deals with. Her books don’t feel far fetched or cheesy because I could see myself being any one of her characters. I also appreciate that the endings to her books are realistic and don’t suddenly discard all the previous obstacles and are true to the characters development!","<span>I loooooved this book and it may be my favourite Abby Jimenez book yet.

R8X0B2CSSM2HA,"A Wonderful, Heartfelt Love Story","Emma and Justin are cursed. Every time each of them dates someone else that person finds their soulmate immediately after.

R2K3ZGKOUGXCLP,Beautifully written,"""You're not asking for too much. You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.""  This book was another win for me by Abby! It was beautiful! This book is about healing from the trauma that is placed on you by others. And is it worth letting those people stay in your life if you're constanting having to put yourself back together after the damage they cause over and over again! So much of this book I could relate to! Which hit so hard! I'm always so grateful for writers like Abby, who put words to emotions I've never been able to!  ☀️  Justin and Emma struggle with the same curse. Whoever they date, the next person they date falls in love with their soul mate!  Emma was used to running. Never putting down roots so she never had to lose anything. So when Justin offers a deal to break their curse together, she agrees, knowing it'll only be temporary. Because temporary she could do. Temporary was her normal!  But Emma wasn't expecting to find a safe place in Justin. And that was scarier than she could have ever imagined. But slowly, Justin shows her what it was like to have someone who is constant and what it feels like to be wanted.  ☀️  A few of my favorite parts: (I tried very hard not to include spoilers but read with caution or dont)  -Justin was such an overthinker, and I loved it!-  “I’m thinking that I like you a lot more than I thought I would. I’m thinking that I probably smell because it’s hot and all my deodorant washed off in the pool, and that this place would be the perfect place to kiss you like I’m supposed to, but I wouldn’t because of the deodorant thing. I’m thinking that this whole thing with your mom and Neil feels weird, and I can’t put my finger on why. I’m thinking that I don’t like her because she’s ignoring you for some guy she just met, and I feel bad that I don’t like her because I know you do. And then I’m wondering if I’m too hard on people, because I can’t stop thinking about what you said earlier, that you should always choose empathy, and if you can choose empathy with someone like that, I should be able to do it with people I love—but I can’t. I’m thinking your bathing suit looks too tight, and it looks uncomfortable like it’s going to leave lines on your skin. I’m thinking about what those lines would look like when you take it off—not in a sexual way, but also sort of in a sexual way.” I felt my face starting to heat up a little. “Aaaaand now I’m wondering if I’ve said too much and what you’re thinking.”  -His surveys were one of my favorite parts of the book. It was perfectly nerdy, and I loved it!‐  ""1. On a scale from Awkward to Charming, how would you rate Justin’s performance?""  -Everyone needs a friend like Maddy! She loved Emma so fiercely. And always knew exactly how to handle her when she fell apart. Even if she didn't agree with the way Emma handled a situation, she was always there to pick her up in the end.-  ""Has Maddy ever killed anyone?"" She pretended to think about it. ""Nobody I can prove."" I was cracking up at her threatening him.  “I want you to know that your empathy is beautiful, Emma. I hope you never lose that. I do hope that one day you get some boundaries though.”  -Emma's relationship with her mom was heartbreaking!-  ""So I became an island-and the island is small. I don't need anyone. And I know that sounds sort of terrible, but it's actualy comforting to know that I have this ability to need no one. It feels like a superpower. Like I'm untouchable.""  -I loved Justin's mothers relationship with her best friend, Leigh. Abby always does such an incredible job with her side characters. Not only do you connect with her main characters. But her aide characters are always wonderful!‐  “Emma, you want to hold one?” Mom asked. She gasped. “Yes!” A hand emerged from the back seat with a tiny chittering raccoon in it wrapped in a bar towel. “This is George Cooney.” Emma took it and held it to her chest and looked at me with hearts in her eyes. “Look at his little hands!”  -There are just so many beautiful parts of this book! But one of my favorite qoutes were....  “Unhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks. You don’t know how broken she was or what she was trying to do to fill those cracks. Being broken is not an excuse for bad behavior, you still have to make good choices and do the right thing. But it can be the reason. And sometimes understanding the reason can be what helps you heal.”  ""The best kind of love doesn’t happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It’s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it’s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about.""  -I usually am dreading Abby's 3rd act breakups! But this time I loved it. The growth that came from it was so needed and the book wouldn't have been the same without it. Was it heartbreaking to read? 1000% But this time it was as beautiful as it was heartbreaking!-  -AND I CANT FORGET THE EASTER EGGS!! I have to admit I didn't see any of those twists coming. But to see that come full circle was pretty cool!  I also listened to the audio after reading the book and it was an incredible performance by Chrstine Lakin and Zachary Webber!!

RFSN138147SCS,An easy 5 star read and will be one of my top favorite reads of 2024!,"Absolutely loved loved loved! I devoured this book, and although I kept trying to pace myself so it would last longer, I ended up finishing it in less than 24 hours, because I just couldn't put it down! An easy 5 star read for me and I have no doubt it'll be one of my top favorite books of 2024!  I was excited about this book's release thinking that I would like it, but I was not expecting to love it as much as I did! My favorite Abby Jimenez book by far! It was absolute perfection. I mean we have a gardening loving, travel nurse as our female main character then we throw in a dash of magical realism?! Are you kidding me? If that book isn't meant for me than I don't know what is! 😂  One of my major conditions on how much I love a rom-com is how it makes me feel while reading it. If the book is giving me butterflies, heart-dropping angst, and making me kick my legs because I am so giddy, then it's 5 star perfection and this, my friends, gave me all of this and more.  The characters were absolutely perfect. As I mentioned earlier, Emma was a FMC of my dreams, but then we get the MMC, Justin, who was just as perfect. From page one, I was hooked and was pleasantly surprised to see what this storyline was all about. Both characters believe their love lives to be cursed. After dating someone and breaking up with them that person always meets the love of their life right after. Discovering one another through a Reddit thread and both sharing the same dilemma, Emma and Justin decide to date for a short period of time to cancel out each other's curse. And well, we all know where this is going. 😉  Another thing I loved and what I really appreciated the author gave us is a believable third act conflict. We all know when picking up a romance, we are getting one. Unfortunately, sometimes they can really mess the flow up for me while reading, because at times they don't feel natural, or they are just plain silly like the dreaded miscommunication trope, which is guaranteed to make my eyes roll. I was so pleasantly surprised we didn't get one of those and instead got a great segue into how the book concludes. 🙌  This is a standalone novel in case anyone was wondering. Abby gives us lots of Easter eggs and it was fun to read her thought process at the end of why she included what. But luckily you don't have to read any of her previous books to enjoy this one and in my opinion, they weren't too spoiler-y.  Overall, and I can't stress this enough I loved it and can't recommend it enough. I feel it would be a slam dunk winner for anyone who decides to pick it up!","<span>Absolutely loved loved loved! I devoured this book, and although I kept trying to pace myself so it would last longer, I ended up finishing it in less than 24 hours, because I just couldn't put it down! An easy 5 star read for me and I have no doubt it'll be one of my top favorite books of 2024!<br><br>I was excited about this book's release thinking that I would like it, but I was not expecting to love it as much as I did! My favorite Abby Jimenez book by far! It was absolute perfection. I mean we have a gardening loving, travel nurse as our female main character then we throw in a dash of magical realism?! Are you kidding me? If that book isn't meant for me than I don't know what is! 😂<br><br>One of my major conditions on how much I love a rom-com is how it makes me feel while reading it. If the book is giving me butterflies, heart-dropping angst, and making me kick my legs because I am so giddy, then it's 5 star perfection and this, my friends, gave me all of this and more.<br><br>The characters were absolutely perfect. As I mentioned earlier, Emma was a FMC of my dreams, but then we get the MMC, Justin, who was just as perfect. From page one, I was hooked and was pleasantly surprised to see what this storyline was all about. Both characters believe their love lives to be cursed. After dating someone and breaking up with them that person always meets the love of their life right after. Discovering one another through a Reddit thread and both sharing the same dilemma, Emma and Justin decide to date for a short period of time to cancel out each other's curse. And well, we all know where this is going. 😉<br><br>Another thing I loved and what I really appreciated the author gave us is a believable third act conflict. We all know when picking up a romance, we are getting one. Unfortunately, sometimes they can really mess the flow up for me while reading, because at times they don't feel natural, or they are just plain silly like the dreaded miscommunication trope, which is guaranteed to make my eyes roll. I was so pleasantly surprised we didn't get one of those and instead got a great segue into how the book concludes. 🙌<br><br>This is a standalone novel in case anyone was wondering. Abby gives us lots of Easter eggs and it was fun to read her thought process at the end of why she included what. But luckily you don't have to read any of her previous books to enjoy this one and in my opinion, they weren't too spoiler-y.<br><br>Overall, and I can't stress this enough I loved it and can't recommend it enough.

R2UVFPUTY45SO5,Rating: 4.25 Stars,"“The best kind of love doesn't happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life.”  “In a world where you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy.”  Read if you Enjoy: * Lake Vibes * He Falls First * Forced Proximity * Online meet-cute * Found family * Dual POV * Mental Health Awareness/ Trauma  Rating:  “You’re not asking too much,” he said. “You were just asking the wrong person. Ask me instead.”  Abby has done it again! This book was everything I expected and more.  First of all, even though this book can be read as a standalone, I would highly recommend reading Part of Your World and Yours Truly first to understand some of the events/characters that take place in this one. Specifically Part of Your World as the big shocker in the end is connected.  Now on to this review! Justin and Emma meet online through a Reddit post as both characters connect over their unfortunate bad luck in love. You see… every time they date someone and they break up, the exes move on to find the love of their lives. Through a mutual pact, they both agree to date each other and “break” their curse. The rules… four dates, one kiss, and a breakup. Not complicated at all, right?  I loved this book! The amount of meaningful quotes and laugh-out-loud moments had me eating the pages. Justin has become a favorite MMC! His ideas for the dates, his surveys, his special moments with Emma, and his love for his family were admirable. This book also handles trauma, a toxic parent, and new guardianship. Abby did a great job navigating the not-so-happy moments on the page as well. Loved Maddie and her unwavering support for Emma.  “You can love someone and still not be willing to give up your way of life for them. And then there are those you love who you’d take a bullet for. It’s all the same emotion, just different levels.”  If you are looking for your next book, pick up Abby. She is an auto-buy author and I can’t wait to read more!","<span>“The best kind of love doesn't happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations.

R1HNDF94K7R6W3,Hunger Games meets Royalty,"Love love loved this book, the novella that recently came out I couldn't get into but I cannot wait for more of the main story.  I loved the world building, the story line, it had me in tears at the end. My heart shattered by decisions made, but the second book release is creeping up and I cannot wait to pick it up.  The story follow Paedyn, she lives in the slums, she's bottom of the food chain. She's what they called an ""Ordinary"" but no one knows this, because if they did it would cost her life. An Ordinary is someone who doesn't have powers, instead she has taught herself, well her father at first taught her, to be extremely observant and she pretends to be a physic. Which she successfully fools everyone.  Now bring in the storyline, Paedyn is a thief, and thiefs steal. She so happens to steal from the younger prince, the future enforcer. But later in the day she sees that the prince is struggling to fight against a really powerful person who has the ability to almost overwhelm someone by stripping them of their power. Now since Paedyn doesn't have powers, she's able to save the prince. But instead, she lands herself as a contestant for the Purging Trials. Which kind of reminds me of Hunger games.  Through these trials she gets to know the prince she saved, but also the other prince as well, the future king. Now that is all I am about to say about the story because you've just got to read it to experience it. Its enticing, its a little slow to begin with but I legitimately could not put the book down for the second half.","<span>Love love loved this book, the novella that recently came out I couldn't get into but I cannot wait for more of the main story.<br><br>I loved the world building, the story line, it had me in tears at the end.

R1ASR7AM5BO73Q,What a wild ride.,"This book has a Hunger Ganes feel to it at times with the trials. Even the love triangle seems similar, and the two princes both vying for Paedyns attention. The powerful abilities of the contestants and Blair, the typical mean girl, and her interaction with everyone was fun to read. I liked Jax and Andy. Their characters were well developed and relatable. The King, as the evil one ruling his kingdom with an iron fist, was someone who deserved his reputation. Kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to watch despite who he had become. Kitt was my least favourite, his rose coloured glasses, and constantly searching for his father's aporoval made him seem weak and more of a puppet than a king to be. Pae was the most interesting, ordinary but strong, loving despite the cruelty of the hand that fate dealt her. She was driven to seek revenge, and in the end, she got more than she bargained for. I can't wait for the book as this one was a page-turner with its twists and revelations.","<span>This book has a Hunger Ganes feel to it at times with the trials.

RDDOJSCZ6FYQO,Captivating low fantasy to go feral for,"That ending had me sobbing. It hurt. A lot.  I have decided after reading this book that I will be absolutely feral for it. The world and characters aren't just created but brought to life. Both Paedyn and Kai are strong and loveable.  I'll be honest, it wasn't perfect, there were editorial mistakes and unnecessary repetition but it's still a 5 to me because I managed to feel all the feels and devour it and everything happening.  While the start is slightly slower I appreciate that as it gives the reader a chance to get to know the world, magic systems and characters a bit before anything too crazy happens (and it does get crazy).  I loved that Lauren didn't try to make Kai or Pae perfect and that made them feel so much more real. They felt like people just trying to survive what their lives threw at them in the only way they'd been raised to know.  Kai is my latest book boyfriend and will probably be hard to beat in future. He radiates power and charisma and it's no wonder he made Paes heart hurt. The way that from the very beginning he has eyes only for her and will do whatever it takes to keep her alive.. The way he doesn't even have to try to learn things about her, he just naturally does because he cares.  Pae is everybit scared as she is strong. She is full of wit, charisma, stubbornness and fierceness. She knows exactly how to be a psychic and how much power she holds. Her confidence is admirable. And the way she tries to stay away from Kai because she doesn't want to hurt him but can't is both and and amazing.  To me the slow Burn romance is what makes it even more amazing. It fits the characters perfectly and to me there is no need for more at this point. It paints the picture of their chemistry and shows exactly who they are deep down.  Also Kitt our future King. There's no way I could forget him. There is a depth to his character that I don't often see in side characters. Where his character finishes at the end of the book could be seen coming but it still doesn't hurt any less.  Overall I am obsessed and will be reading the next books asap. I also will be booking in my next tattoo shortly (lemon meringue and butterscotch) I don't even care if it becomes a tamlin tattoo 😅","<span>That ending had me sobbing. It hurt. A lot.<br><br>I have decided after reading this book that I will be absolutely feral for it. The world and characters aren't just created but brought to life. Both Paedyn and Kai are strong and loveable.<br><br>I'll be honest, it wasn't perfect, there were editorial mistakes and unnecessary repetition but it's still a 5 to me because I managed to feel all the feels and devour it and everything happening.<br><br>While the start is slightly slower I appreciate that as it gives the reader a chance to get to know the world, magic systems and characters a bit before anything too crazy happens (and it does get crazy).<br><br>I loved that Lauren didn't try to make Kai or Pae perfect and that made them feel so much more real.

R1LDOXOO4W13Z9,Blog Once Upon a Time a Book,"Nel mondo di Paedyn Gray coloro che non hanno poteri alla nascita, i cosiddetti Ordinari, non possono vivere. Vengono letteralmente uccisi. E tutti coloro che cercheranno di nasconderli avranno la stessa fine. Chi si occuperà di questo? Kai. Kai è un Elite figlio del re, colui che ha uno dei più importanti poteri, capire se le persone hanno o meno un potere ed incanalarlo per utilizzarlo a sua volta. Il destino a volte è davvero bizzarro, perché a causa di varie vicissitudini Paedyn si ritroverà a salvare il caro principe dal Silenziatore. Ovvero coloro che hanno il potere di annullare tutti gli altri poteri. Ma questo salvataggio sarà anche la sua rovina, perché da lì a poco si ritroverà iscritta al torneo, dove ci sarà un solo vincitore. E dove la morte può trovarti in ogni prova. Inutile dirvi che fin dal primo incontro tra i due succederà qualcosa che li porterà ad essere sempre più attratti gli uni dagli altri. Ma entrambi hanno dei segreti che li allontanerà sempre più fino a diventare dei veri e propri nemici. Quello che però si ritroveranno a vivere, non dipende da loro, ma da un passato che li segnerà per sempre, dove intrighi, ribelli, soppressioni, torture, allenamenti, dolori, solitudini e soprattutto mancanza di amore, faranno da sfondo. Ho davvero adorato questo romanzo, non quanto per le scene che mi hanno tenuta con il fiato sospeso, quando per i protagonisti, che ad ogni incontrano si ritrovano a scoprire e a donarsi. Donare e condividere tutto. Nel bene e nel male. Portandoli sempre più a dipendere gli uni dall’altri. Kai è meraviglioso, dolce e spietato, bellissimo e nello stesso tempo timido, amorevole verso tutti coloro che ama. Paedyn dall’altra parte cercherà di sopravvivere e di ottenere quella vendetta che l’ha privata di tutto. Io ve lo stra consiglio, tra l’altro uscirà a breve in Italia grazie alla Newton Compton Editori, quindi forza!

R30SBKB3TZEJN4,Now THIS is how you write tension!!,"Now THIS is how you write tension!! Hats off to Lauren Roberts for physically having me on the edge of my seat while reading this book. This is an absolutely astounding debut novel, I found myself completely immersed, devouring it in practically one sitting because it was just that addicting!  I felt very Hunger Games meets The Serpent and the Wings of Night vibes from the beginning, but don't be fooled, this is a masterpiece all in it's own!!  This is a book is truly designed for those who crave a true romantic fantasy, it encompasses every element that I love with a few more that I didn't even realize I needed! As a devout fan of the forbidden love trope, this one hit all the right notes. Paedyn and Kai were utterly captivating, I couldn't get enough of their interactions. The tension and banter were not only fulfilling but also entertaining! There is the perfect combination of action, tension, romance and intrigue to keep the reader hooked the entire way through.  Paedyn, as the leading female character, was a force to be reckoned with. Her storyline will have you on her side from the very beginning, she is courageous, tenacious and has a heart of gold! She embodied a refreshing and fun character, and I can't wait to see the twists and turns that this series has in store for her. Kai is intriguing and incredibly charming, his interactions with Pae allowed the reader to feel their palpable chemistry. His own intriguing backstory only adds to the excitement, and I'm eagerly anticipating more of his character's development. We also get to meet a host of side characters, some who I really hope are a larger part of the next part in this series!  This book is a must-read for anyone enamored with romantasy! It seamlessly weaves together all of the essential elements while still feeling fresh and unique in it’s own way!","<span>Now THIS is how you write tension!!

The Elites have possessed powers for decades, gifted to them by the Plague, while those born Ordinary are just that, banished from the kingdom and shunned from society.  No one knows this better than Paedyn Gray, an Ordinary posing as an Elite. When she unsuspectingly saves one of Ilya’s princes, Kai Azer, she’s thrown into the Purging Trials, a brutal competition to showcase her ‘Elite’ powers.

I especially loved Paedyn’s fierce and powerful personality as I think from a female perspective it shows courage to not give up , plus we love a bad b**ch over here 🫶🏼  whilst I LOVED the whole book and can’t fault the way it made me feel , as a reader who finds it hard to concentrate and zones out (a lot) this book was quite long and if I’m being honest I think it could’ve been shortened.

R186AZFSIHKJLR,THIS book is the best!!!,"This book is one i cannot stop recommending for literally anyone!! It had me on my toes, wondering what was gonna happen next.  The story is set in the kingdom of Ilya, which is divided between the Elites, who possess powers, and the Ordinaries, who do not. The Ordinaries are hunted down and killed due to the belief that they spread disease among the Elites. The protagonist, Paedyn Gray, is an Ordinary who pretends to be a psychic to survive in the slums. However, when she saves the life of one of the king's sons, Kai, she is thrown into the Purging Trials, a competition that showcases the powers of the Elites. Paedyn must do whatever it takes to hide her secret and survive, all while battling her growing feelings for the prince.  Paedyn’s personality is one i admire, she is resourceful and skilled, using her skills to get through all the trials whilst being an “Ordinary.” She’s determined, risking her life to fight for her place. It broke my heart reading what she went through, but knowing she’s a strong soul that won’t ever stop fighting it relieved me to see her push her way through everything.  Kai Azer first got saved by Paedyn, as he becomes her love interest. They go from enemies to potential lovers, along with SO much tension! He has a great sense of humour, but most of what people see from the outside is just a mere mask. He has his own struggles, one of the biggest being meeting his father’s expectations. Everything he went through was heartbreaking, knowing he got so strong by what his father has done to him.  When i was done reading this book i was on the verge of tears, since the last 20 pages completely broke me apart. This book has so many plot-twists, and it is so well-written. Everything the characters have done had reasonings, and i’m excited for the second book to come out. 🥹🤍","<span>This book is one i cannot stop recommending for literally anyone!!

His coach, who doesn’t even know what we are doing, came up and commented on how much harder he worked at practice this week, and the change in his focus. He also did his first speech for school recently, and I showed him how to use these techniques on overcoming the anxiety around this as well. These are great tools for them to learn to have forever.

R3N9VMC68YQSL,Basketball Team Summer Book Club Top Pick!,"If you are an athlete you know you’d rather be playing your sport than reading. But I had my son read this book to see if we should read it for his basketball team’s book club. And it was an instant winner, even beating out Kobe’s Mamba Mentality. Below is a summary of strengths and a recommendation from my 5th grader.  From the introduction, this book captures the young reader’s attention and it just continues to flow. The use of bold lettering, bullet points, and spacing makes this an easier read to stick with than a lot of other books. You can pause in between chapters and feel confident picking the book back up. I love the chapter summaries, quotes, and stories about successful athletes and their families. The authors clearly paint the picture that mental toughness is as, if not more important, than athletic ability.  If this book is ever revised, consider ending the chapter with the exercise on it’s own page (after the summary and book recommendation) or end the book with all exercises combined. That way it’s easier to find and repeat each exercise daily in between readings. -","<span>If you are an athlete you know you’d rather be playing your sport than reading.

R3MG4TXSTE9LXG,Little Girls Can be Tough Too!,"So, my daughter decides to take up Football (Soccer) having had no interest until nearly 8 years old, when suddenly the bug takes hold following a school trial session and a suggestion from a friend to give it a go.  Fast forward nearly three years and she has made fantastic progress in a very short time with a recent invite for an academy trial with the biggest local team!  Now the road to this point has been bumpy and props to my daughter for showing the courage to continue despite them but, one thing that did significantly help her (and myself as ‘Dad coach’), was this little gem of a book I stumbled upon whilst considering how to help her become more focused and able to understand that sport comes with it’s bumps and bruises and it’s ok to be competitive and ‘give it back’ as it were (within the rules) as sport is a different thing than our day to day manner, something I noticed many similar age struggle with.  We read through the book together one chapter at a time and then I would sit back and let the ideas marinate only to stand back in awe to see her apply the very ideas and have a new level of determination show through in the very next game! So much so, her coaches were taken aback too and it made for a new central position in the team with her new found battling instinct to pair with her already formidable athleticism and rapidly improving skills and tactical understanding.  Regardless of the sport your little one has chosen, the path will have many similarities given it’s ‘the mind the drives the thing’, so consider purchasing this very reasonably priced and highly accessible little book for them to read and watch how it influences them to show their best selves too!","<span>So, my daughter decides to take up Football (Soccer) having had no interest until nearly 8 years old, when suddenly the bug takes hold following a school trial session and a suggestion from a friend to give it a go.<br><br>Fast forward nearly three years and she has made fantastic progress in a very short time with a recent invite for an academy trial with the biggest local team!<br><br>Now the road to this point has been bumpy and props to my daughter for showing the courage to continue despite them but, one thing that did significantly help her (and myself as ‘Dad coach’), was this little gem of a book I stumbled upon whilst considering how to help her become more focused and able to understand that sport comes with it’s bumps and bruises and it’s ok to be competitive and ‘give it back’ as it were (within the rules) as sport is a different thing than our day to day manner, something I noticed many similar age struggle with.<br><br>We read through the book together one chapter at a time and then I would sit back and let the ideas marinate only to stand back in awe to see her apply the very ideas and have a new level of determination show through in the very next game!

R142ONZ7Y4FHFJ,My favourite Emily Henry book so far!!,"As an already exisiting fan girl of Emily Henry's, I can confidently say that Funny Story is my favourite book from her so far. Daphne & Mile’s story had me laughing, tearing up, and nodding along in recognition with her journeys and struggles the entire way. Never before have I resonated with a story on such a deep level. The main character's experiences mirrored my own in many ways, making it feel like I was reading about a close friend rather than a fictional character.

RPM0E2SSR2C,Emily Henry’s new best,"Emily Henry is the Queen of the romance genre right now and this is her new best.  Daphne has just been left by her fiancé weeks before the wedding, and her only option for a roommate in a short notice is Miles, who girlfriend just left him for Daphnes fiancé.

Just like every one of her other romance novels, the characters are fleshed out and real and the chemistry between them is to die for. I think what makes Emily Henry’s novels stand out is how she includes really emotional subplots and difficult real-life struggles for these. There is so much substance and depth in the story that the emotional moments hit harder.  But the reason why I think this is Emily Henry’s best work yet, is because (true to its name) it’s incredibly funny. I can’t name a book I have laughed at more.

R2B82TGX6AVU2U,A beautiful and tender romance,"The day that Peter decided that he was actually in love with his childhood best friend, Petra and not his fiancé, Daphne, was the day that Daphne’s new life story began. Stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian, she begins her countdown to when she can leave and begin a new life, far away from Peter and Petra. The only person who could possibly understand her predicament is Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak. When Daphne proposes to Miles that she be his roommate, begins their friendship. Upon discovering that Petra and Peter are engaged, their friendship goes one step further, when they post misleading photos of themselves together as a couple. Yet, as Miles and Daphne explore Waning Bay together, they discover their feelings are more than those of friends. This was such a beautiful and tender romance, where I found myself savouring every conversation between Miles and Daphne, as they revealed their past hurts. I did not want to miss one part of it. Here are two characters that were quite destroyed by their exes and yet, took solace in each other, never complaining when one of them divulged parts of their past relationship. Emily Henry manages to gradually unpeel the layers away from all her characters so that by the time I finished reading this story, I could see how the first impressions of Miles was not who he was deep down. Likewise, I loved how Daphne grew in confidence from her friendship with Miles and could see Peter for who he truly was. Great secondary characters which further added to this wonderful story.

RLWSRD7H1MG5C,5 stars,"Well, I *think* I've found my new fave Emily Henry story! I mean, I always love her books, but there was something about this one that just really hit deep. I haven't laughed/cried so deeply and interchangeably in a long time, and it was an absolute delight to read Henry's latest book.  Funny Story is about two characters, Daphne and Miles, whose (now ex-)partners leave them to be together. Understandably, Daphne is devastated when her ex-fiancé, Peter, breaks off their engagement to shack up with his childhood best friend Petra.  Suddenly finding herself fiancé-less and homeless, Daphne moves in with also newly single, Miles. And, funny story... it might be the best thing that ever happened to either of them!  One of my favourite things about this story was how two completely opposite characters dealt with their horrible break-ups and fell into a seemingly unlikely friendship. At face value, they couldn't be more different, and yet, underneath it all, they were more similar than imagined.  It was also really enjoyable to see the differences between Daphne's relationship with Peter (ugh) and Miles (happy sigh). And, it wasn't necessarily even big things/moments. It showed a lot of hidden depth about how people are often willing to accept the love/effort we think we deserve. Daphne went through a lot of personal growth in this book and I was absolutely here for it.  And Miles. I don't even have words for how much I adored Miles. He also had some thinking/growing up to do, but I have nothing but heart eyes for that man.  If you enjoy contemporary romance and/or opposites attract, check out this book! It was so enjoyable, I stayed up half the night to binge-read it in one sitting; I have no regrets. Five stars all around.","<span>Well, I *think* I've found my new fave Emily Henry story!

R34EKHSA5TBHL,Emily Henry does it again!,"“You’re worth it, Daphne,” he says, hand soft on my jaw and eyes closed.  Rating: 4.5/5  - Fake dating - Roommates to lovers - Ex’s new fiancé’s ex! - Librarian FMC & bartender MMC - Single POV  I just love Emily’s writing so much! It’s like coming home – the perfect blend of witty banter, descriptive prose, and tender moments. Her banter always delivers, and I freaking love it!  “You are either the friendliest man on the planet or a world‑class serial killer.” ""Why not both?""  The premise of Funny Story is captivating from the get-go! An awkward librarian who loves schedules and can’t handle small talk gets dumped by her fiancé after he declares his love for his “platonic” best friend.  So what else is she supposed to do but move in with her ex’s new fiancé’s ex? And when they get sent wedding invitations, it makes sense to fake a relationship to make them jealous. And for Miles, the nicest guy on the planet, to show her around and make her fall in love with their town… and maybe him in the process.  Daphne and Miles were very much opposites, but I loved their comradeship and dynamic. He had this easygoing, natural way of pushing her out of her shell and supporting her while cataloguing all the small things that made her HER.  But as with all of Emily’s books, Funny Story is not without its layers. In this instance, it’s complex family dynamics. It’s Daphne being left behind by those who love her, making her scared to take that leap with Miles for fear he’ll end up not wanting her around, too. It's Miles letting Daphne see all the parts of himself.  “I do want all those parts of you.” “Good. They want you too.” Then he kIsses me. It’s perfect.  Also, this is 100% Emily’s h0rniest book yet, and I was here for it.

RE4ZG4KW9XRPN,"Romantic, sexy, heart-warming and funny","In Funny Story we meet Daphne who was engaged to marry Peter – he loved to tell people the funny story of how they met. But during his bachelor party, he realised he was in love with his childhood best friend, Petra and he calls off the wedding, kicking Daphne out of the house which he reminds her is his. Daphne is devastated and plans to leave Waning Bay in Michigan as soon as the readathon at the public library where she works as a children’s librarian is over. She finds herself sharing an apartment with Miles, Petra’s ex who is similarly devastated. They are both shocked when Peter and Petra announce a wedding date very quickly and Daphne in a moment of madness agrees to go with Miles, pretending that they are now dating. To start off with she thinks Miles is a pot smoking looser but as she gets to know him, she realises that this was Peter’s opinion, and she discovers he is much more than that. Funny Story was an absolute joy to read, I loved everything about this book. It has • A character who is a dedicated children’s librarian and who loves reading • A very sexy and kind man • A bit of a guide to all the best places to visit in Waning Bay (I want to go!) Daphne realises she had essentially uprooted her life to be with Peter, seeing his friends and family and having none of her own. Even one of her old friends seems to have taken Peter's side. She makes friends with the wonderful Ashleigh whom she works with, and she soon starts to make more connections. We hear about her upbringing – a loving single mum who worked hard but whose changing jobs meant they moved around a lot, meaning she struggled to make and keep friends. Her dad was big on the promises but not so much on the following through. My first Emily Henry (I know – I’m sorry!) I always knew she would be an author I would love but there are just so many other books to read (most of them on my shelves). I’m now on a mission to complete my Emily Henry collection and read them all as soon as possible. An absolute joy – romantic, sexy, heart-warming and funny!

R3EC1QFD9EGKM6,It’s kind of a funny story…,"Is Funny Story going to change your life? Probably not. Does it turn the genre on its head? Not really.  But is it a comfortable, loving exploration of two people figuring out how to allow themselves the space to find happiness alone and together?  Yes. It is.  It’s also quite funny.  I can’t offer you anything you don’t already know, but I’ll share some things that resonated with me.  It’s a love letter to libraries, a safe place for me as an awkward teenager, a welcoming place when I was a struggling new mom, a familiar place for me as an adult — all of which are touched on in this book, too. And Daphne is…well, me, in many ways.  There are songs (and not Taylor Swift ones, natch) that bring a few scenes even more vibrance: Neil Young, Tommy James, the Eagles. Shout out to unexpected deep dives, songs I pulled up when they were mentioned so I could groove along with Miles and Daphne.  The premise includes familiar tropes: forced proximity, roommates to lovers, fake dating, but honestly those take a back seat to the actual belief that you’re watching these two fall in love. It’s slow and purposeful and so sweet.  The banter is laugh out loud funny and romantic, the setting (I spent a week one summer traveling around the entirety of the Michigan mitten!) feels a little bit travel brochure, a little bit love letter, and the difficult realizations Miles and Daphne come to are hard fought.  —— Miles and Daphne are heartbroken when her fiancée dumps her for his girlfriend, once his childhood best friend. Confused? Well, it’s kind of a funny story. They end up roommates of convenience, but end up in love inconveniently. Daphne counts down the days until she can move anywhere else — after her big read-a-thon event — and Miles uses the time to make her fall in love with Michigan.

R2F5ZDUZ4FJ0CI,Sweet romance,"Fun, sweet romance. Well structured with enjoyable dialogue and plot. I liked it and would definitely recommend it for a light, easy read. There were a few themes in this book that I'm finding more commonly used by contemporary authors that I didn't love. First, the assumption that self-discovery requires irresponsible, rebellious, and self harming behavior. (smoking cigars, smoking weed, excessive drinking, gambling, one night stands, etc. Etc). Maybe for some people that's what it looks like (and that's OK) I just don't like the implication that that's the route for everyone and that those that don't at least at some point in their lives try those things are repressed and stunted. That is simply not true and should not be hocked as if it is Second, can we stop blaming our parents for everything? This theme is taking over in contemporary literature, and it's annoying. Grow up people and take responsibility for your own actions and stop acting like your whole life is a victim to your parents. Parents are people, and they screw up their kids. Be an adult and get over it. I'm not saying there aren't some very traumatizing things that create lifelong hurt, but to blame every relationship issue and personal flaw on your parents is childish and a trope way too often used these days. End of rant. And to leave on a positive note, lol. While those themes are frustrating and gaining way too much traction, I don't think they ruin the book. So if you are looking for something to binge read and not feel like it was a total waste of time, give this book a try. Happy reading!","<span>Fun, sweet romance.

R3JF8OOZV1S9II,"Sweet, hilarious romcom with depth and spice. Highly recommend!","I had to take a few days and gather my thoughts after reading this book. This was my 2nd Emily Henry book and I really loved it. From the very first chapter I was completely enthralled in her characters and storytelling. Being told solely from the FMC Daphne’s perspective made me feel like I was her and her struggles were so relatable to me.  The insecurities she felt, and the difficulty she had feeling like she “fit in”, her buttoned up persona that desired to be more spontaneous but found it hard to make that leap, her relationship troubles with her family and her “almost” in laws, and of course her love of libraries and books.  The ache she felt for a place to belong and to feel wanted and chosen was so beautifully written and made it even more special to watch her “found family” come together.  Ok mushy deep feelings aside… this book was so funny. The snarky internal monologue she had about the terrible situation she found herself in by no fault of her own was so perfect.  And then there’s Miles… oh my goodness. This guy is her polar opposite and exactly what she didn’t know she needed. He SEES her in a way that no man ever has and the chemistry between them is so undeniable that it never felt like a rebound and you couldn’t help but cheer them on! He’s the eternal optimist to her pessimistic self and the guy that can make a friend anytime anywhere without even trying while she is the girl that watches with awe from the sidelines. I absolutely love couples like this who are opposite but bring out the best in each other.  The setting was perfect for a spring or summer read with the adorable small town full of sweet side characters. Scenes at the beach, library, wine bar, and farm stand. Delicious food and wine…It made the story so cozy.  This book was one that I did not want to put down. I laughed. I cried. I was smiling at the very last line which wrapped the whole book up so perfectly and brought everything full circle.  I highlighted so much of this book… here are a few favorites:  “For someone with the innate social charm of a mounted fish (me), watching Miles befriend this stranger felt like seeing Michelangelo paint the Sistine Chapel: impressive, but also dizzying. Like any second, he might fall off his ladder and splatter on the marble below.”  “I remember loving a story. Feeling like I was living it. Being, even as a child, bowled over by how something imaginary could become real, could wring every emotion from me or make me homesick for places I’d never been.”  “Things were allowed to be complicated. They were allowed to be messy. We were allowed to disagree and argue and even hurt each other, on occasion, and it didn’t mean it was time to let the revolving door of life carry us away from each other. Sometimes things are hard. They just are.”  ARC was provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

RJPTJ91P9REJL,Disappointed and didn't feel it had quite the same caliber as her previous books unfortunately.,"3 very disappointing stars. 😔  I am so sad to report that I didn't enjoy this book. And shocked to be quite honest. When I pick up an Emily Henry book, I can always guarantee I am going to have a good time. I usually never give any of her books anything less than 5 stars. I anxiously await them every year, and because they always release around this time of year, I know when to expect them and I count down the weeks til its arrival! But I just couldn't connect with her latest and found myself oftentimes bored. I usually have trouble putting her books down and I found myself going hours without picking this one up nor was I excited to. Emily can't always get it right I suppose.  They say if you loved People We Meet On Vacation, you'll love Happy Place, and if you loved Beach Read, you'll enjoy Book Lovers. Although as I mentioned I loved all her prior books, I'm definitely in the Happy Place/PWMOV category and if I had to rank them, Happy Place would definitely be my #1! I'm curious to see where this one falls for everyone else. I saw mixed reviews early on, but I scoffed at them and kept my expectations high, because I've never had an EH book flop for me!  While reading this book, I kept trying to put my finger on what it exactly it was that wasn't working for me. And although, there wasn't a concrete ""ah-a"" moment, I do believe it was a combination of things, so let me try to break them down.  One issue for me was the main characters. I didn't jive with either one. Daphne was too much of a stick in the mud and ironically enough, I did relate to her in certain ways, so I don't know what that says about me. 😅 Unfortunately, it wasn't enough for me to become attached to her though. Then we have Miles. I don't know if it was just how I pictured him or Henry didn't do a great job playing him up, but the mental picture I had of him made me think he was unkempt and just wasn't doing a good job pulling off his beard. 😂 So yea, I had trouble with him winning me over as well. He seemed nice and charming! And I loved how they were opposites, but I just didn't feel like they were memorable.  Another issue I had with the book was the overall story. It was just kinda too sad and depressing. I know we are coming in on the two main characters ending their serious relationships and picking up the pieces of their broken heart. I also know she couldn't just have them move on over night to make it feel realistic. But it felt like the majority of the story we were slugging through this part of their story to where I was just ready to move on! Give me the good stuff!  The banter and even alot of the jokes fell flat for me also. When the side characters started playing a more important role, I thought it improved, but if the main characters aren't giving it to me, we have a problem.  I never got giddy or the butterflies in my stomach I come to expect from her writing. I had no emotional attachment to the story or the characters making this book completely unremarkable to me and completely forgettable.  I will say I thought it was very clever how Henry started this book and then ended the book! I loved that part and it gave me a little glimmer of why I love her writing so much! I'm really hoping this one was a one off for me and this time next year I will be back raving and begging anyone and everyone to go read her latest book. I know it is unrealistic for me to love every book and we all have different opinions, but I am so bummed it didn't work out. I'd recommend loaning this from the library versus purchasing and hopefully you won't be like me and will absolutely adore it!","<span>3 very disappointing stars. 😔<br><br>I am so sad to report that I didn't enjoy this book.

R16IQSUXVPDL2W,There’s a Reason EH is an Automatic Buy.,"I’ll be honest, I was hesitant to pick this one up. Because Happy Place was such a deeply emotional read for me, and caps the front end of what has been a record-breaking reading year for me, I had doubts this book would live up to HP or any of the 100+ other books I’ve read since last April.  Well I should have known it would all be fine. Emily it’s a stunning writer to me. She writes these incredibly flawed/traumatized/confused/beautiful/lovable/relatable characters that I can’t help but feel kinship with. I care so deeply about each of them and would root for them to find happiness in the end even if it wasn’t together - though, of course, I’m pleased as pie when there is a HEA. I am a diehard contemporary romance (+smut) reader, and yet I never annoyed at the limited spice, nor do I think what she does include could be cut out without changing the story. I think that takes some skill!  I loved that this interaction of “book industry lady” in Daphne was a librarian, and to see the beautiful community that blossomed there. The neighbors of Waning Bay were so cozy and just made me want to visit a tiny town in Michigan this summer (though when do EH books not inspire that).  The chemistry between Daphne and Miles was so natural and lovely and believable. Sometimes there are people you don’t think you’d connect with in a million years, and then you just slip into this wonderful, easy dynamic. Their banter was great, and you could really see the ways they GOT one another and brought out good, healthy things/change in one another. Their flaws and conflicts and miscommunications felt so true to life, and even the way they found their ways back (to one another and to other characters) was everything I wanted. Not too quick or easy, and with markers of a well planned character arc.  I love that Emily does “show not tell” so well in her writing, allowing characters to wrestle and struggle and doubt themselves and their own love story, rather than falling in love because they’re supposed to and expecting the reader to just get on board.  I feel like I could go on and on with the positivity, which is why this is a 5⭐️ read for me (even if I was leaning towards a 4 while reading). Not a life-changing book, but one I’ll surely be returning to again and again, could absolutely throw me into a reading slump, and that I enjoyed over and beyond enough to recommend.","<span>I’ll be honest, I was hesitant to pick this one up.

This entire story is from our FMC Daphne's POV but the character growth for both Daphne and Miles is spectacular. Daphne and Miles are both opposites: Daphne is pessimistic, reserved, and has a hard time connecting with people, where Miles makes friends wherever he goes. They both have family trauma that drives both of their actions. The friendship and ultimate love story unfolds almost take a backseat to the growth and self-discovery, especially for Daphne who has been neglected much of her life. She moved to this small town for her ex and now needs to decide if she can make this place her home or does she pack up and go somewhere else?  Miles is the perfect imperfect man. He is upbeat and optimistic, but his underlying emotional flaws really tugged at my heart for him. I also loved the way he encouraged Daphne to open up and guided her to become more comfortable with herself.  The romance was so sweet and swoony, the banter is phenomenal, not only between our MCs but also the supporting cast of characters like Ashleigh and Julia. There's some spice and conflict, all of which makes this such a fantastic romantic comedy. It's what you expect but also so much more. This needs to be a movie ASAP.

RXQMOEHM4MUUW,it’s not even funny how much i loved this book,"!!!!! I can’t even put into words how much I love this book. I love Daphne and Miles so much, but especially Miles. To be honest, I don’t think i have ever been more in love with a fictional character in my life (LOL). There are obviously parts of this book that are a little unrealistic, though I adore the fictional little town of Waning Bay Michigan more than i can say and i would move there in a heartbeat if i could. I think the thing that stood out to me most about this book was how real the things the characters struggled with were. I loved the fact that Daphne didn’t have one best friend her whole life (which i feel like is a common issue in a lot of books i read) and tried so hard to fit in with Peter’s family and friends and based her whole life around him only to feel like she lost her whole identity when they broke up (another common occurrence I believe). Being in her 30s, she’s never felt like she had a close friend she could tell everything to until she meets Ashleigh and i am just so happy Emily Henry included that part. The other thing I loved about this book is that there were no characters I didn’t like. Everyone was likable and relatable in some way (except maybe Peter and Petra lol) and maybe it is the introvert in me but I liked that Daphne didn’t have a million friends and wasn’t surrounded by a ton of people all the time. It’s hard to find characters that are relatable, and i found myself relating to her in many ways throughout the book. Just perfection in every way.","<span>!!!!!
