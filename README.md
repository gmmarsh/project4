# Project Title
Topic modeling using unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get your copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
#### Installing
##### Virtual Environment
* to create, enter python3 -m venv venv(name of your choosing) in the command line interface
* to activate in a UNIX system, enter source venv(the name of your environment)/bin/activate
* to activate in a Windows system using Gitbash, enter source/venv(the name of your environment)/Scripts/activate
##### Requirements Installation
* first, activate project environment
* second, pip install -r requirements.txt




End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Running the tests


### Break down into end to end tests


### And coding style tests


## Deployment

### Built With
* Flask was used to create an application programming interface (API). The API takes in requests, uses the machine learning model to make predictions based on the data in those requests and send back the prediction responses.
