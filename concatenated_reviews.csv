RKVHT9DHT15GV,Unlock the psychology behind your personal finances,"""The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness"" is a thought-provoking book that provides valuable insights into the psychology behind personal finance. The author, Morgan Housel, presents a refreshing perspective on money and how it intersects with our lives, both practically and emotionally.  What stood out most to me was the engaging writing style, which made complex concepts easy to understand. Housel uses real-world examples to illustrate his points, making the book relatable and relevant. Additionally, the author's focus on the behavioral aspect of personal finance, rather than just the technical aspect, is insightful and refreshing.  However, if you are like me you may have expected some sort of actionable advice on managing money, this was not the case. While it provides a valuable understanding of the psychology behind money, it does not offer specific tips or strategies for managing one's finances.  I read this book on the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, and it was a very enjoyable and seamless read on the device, showing that it was well adapted to the e-reader.  Overall, ""The Psychology of Money"" would be best suited for readers who are interested in understanding the intersection between money and psychology. It would be particularly useful for those who may struggle with managing their finances or those who are seeking a new perspective on personal finance. The book is a great read for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of the emotional and psychological drivers behind our financial decisions. This is a staple in a collection for building a better financial mindset.",0857197681,"<span>""The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness"" is a thought-provoking book that provides valuable insights into the psychology behind personal finance.

RAT649PLIEI5F,Super food recipes for your best friends!,"I was so excited to receive my hard cover copy however while waiting there was a pre release in our area of the book where I also received a free signed copy and met the authors. This is not just a book of knowledge but has beautiful photographs to inspire your mind while you make new recipes for your beloved pet. Rodney is a bit of a local hero in his home town and I have had the pleasure of working with him years ago to help two of my pets. One with cancer and one with stomach issues. His help helped them both live longer and healthier lives. Dr.Becker is also amazing and the co authors work so well together,to give us easy to ready and follow instructions,to make our pets lives longer and healthier.

R1HDNJBXGCSXKR,Excellent Story - Amazon Damaged My Book.,"It's minor damage, but I ordered a new, unused copy. From the damage on the spine, book jacket, etc., it looked more like it's been used before. There was no protective packaging, either. Not impressed as my copy of Fourth Wing came in pristine condition, with protective packaging. Not sure where to turn that issue in, if that's a here issue or to take it up with Amazon another route.  As far as sequels go, I really enjoyed this one. It's still very much Fourth Wing and the Fourth Wing World, but it's it own beast entirely. I think the first one is still a bit better, but as far as the book itself goes - was very enjoyable. I still laughed, cried, went through the paces. I can't wait for Black Onyx to come out. A bit terrified, as how the story leaves off.  I also wouldn't consider this book, or the whole series, as ""spicy."" I kind of have to laugh, because it's really tame. The scenes are good, don't get me wrong. I feel like there could be more without taking away from the story. Perhaps some descriptive language. But the way people rave about it makes it seem like they're doing the horizontal tango every chapter. They do not. Maybe that says something about me and the filthy things I've read prior, but uh...I wouldn't even consider this super smutty.  Honestly, I really like the balance of story, romance, action and adventure. That's some elements of a perfect book for me.  I really like and recommend this series.",1649374178,"<span>It's minor damage, but I ordered a new, unused copy.

Book 1 set the stage and book 2 delves into the inner workings of our beloved characters, adding more depth and evolution. This book reads like a roughing out of the edges, in preparation for the momentous events to come. Whereas Fourth Wing captured my heart and soul and left me begging for more, Iron Flame ensured that I remained faithful, as we wait for the rest of the story to unfold. Warning: another cliffhanger ending without a potential release date for book 3.  I am a hardcore fan of The Empyrean, a romantic fantasy series set in a dragon rider war academy, and Iron Flame, book 2, did not disappoint in the least. I love Rebecca Yarros' writing style and all of her characters are 😘 (even the ones that you love to hate). Fast paced in some parts and slower moving in others, Yarros keeps you on edge, guessing throughout. You need to read book 1 (Fourth Wing) before reading Iron Flame, as it is a continuation of the major cliffhanger that we were dealt at the end of book 1. I was tugging my hair in frustration at times, wanting to slap some sense into some of the characters, and cheering them on for their strength and tenacity at times.  ❤️: At its very core, The Empyrean is a romance series. The romantic ups and downs between Xaden and Violet is present throughout book 2 (sometimes in a deliciously frustrating way). Which bring us to... 👫: Characters & evolution: Violet and Xaden have much to learn about themselves, individually, as people and as warriors, and as a couple, and this book takes them through a myriad of emotional and physical challenges. I love that Yarros' characters can be both very strong and very vulnerable at once. I connected with Violet's vulnerable side. Both characters are flawed, which makes them relatable.

R1EM83WEEXVRE8,"But, I LOVE Xaddy!","Again, the hype is still real. JUST. READ. IT!  After making it through the first year - something no one (except, of course, the greatest man ever written, Xaden aka Xaddy) believed possible for her - Violet is now a second year. Parapet and threshing are comparable to the training that happens in second year as this is when, according to Xaden ""... the rest of us lose our humanity"".  New-ish characters placed in her path are literally out to ensure Violet doesn't make it to third year. She'll have to fight and push herself even harder than last year and truly understand what it means to not only be a rider, but a rider whose dragon is mated.  ""Secrets make for poor leverage. They die with the people who keep them"" and while many a secret come to light, I can not begin to fathom the amount left to be overturned. SO much happens within these 623 pages it feels like it was both a longer and shorter book at the same time. It does start off a little slow, but things pick up, and it hurts putting it down. Information, memories, back story, future possibilities as well as the past are thrown at us with every turn of the page.  The dragons banter is even better this time around. The spice and longing tension has been turned up, and Chapter 48 is an absolute 🌶 masterpiece. More signets are learned, closer bonds between the squads are born, friendship and relationships are tested, & so much more information around what happened in Resson comes to light.  As expected, this ends on another unsuspected cliffhanger, like Fourth Wing did before it - and this one has me distraught beyond belief! I have no words to accurately convey the emotions i am still processing; where I did have multiple ideas of where Iron Flame was going to end, where it did hadn't even crossed my mind!  What is trust, and how can you earn or give it to someone whole? Is the enemy of my enemy really my friend? Do HEA's exist on the Continent? Is there an antidote for everything? Can people truly be redeemed? Are all lives of equal value? What more do the Dragons know? Whats the cost of a royal title? Is forgiveness for you, or them? Is sacrifice truly a gift? Are grudges worth holding onto? Is love enough?  This series is all consuming, and once again I'm left wondering what next to do with myself; we don't yet even have a release date for book 3! All we have is fellow readers, and a love for Xaden - hopefully Malek grants that to be enough.  Thank you @rebeccayarros , but also WTF?!  Original thoughts:  I am distraught.

Iron Flame picks up where Fourth Wing left off - right smack in the middle of the twist of all twists (IYKYK). I finished a couple days ago, but I had to stew in my feelings.. The book was amazing!! There’s no doubting my love for this world and Rebecca’s writing. Fourth wing is where I fell in love with Basgiath, dragons, a strong-minded heroine and a few of her friends, and the most obvious - Xaden Riorson. Iron Flame left me feeling broken, defeated, sad - ANGRY! And also the book where I started my long sh!t list of characters I loathe – yes, LOATHE 🤭. I mean, I can’t be the only one who has a hard time with trust and redemption..  ᴡᴇ ᴀʀᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴇᴀᴘᴏɴs, ᴀɴᴅ ᴛʜɪs ᴘʟᴀᴄᴇ ɪs ᴛʜᴇ sᴛᴏɴᴇ ᴛʜᴇʏ ᴜsᴇ ᴛᴏ sʜᴀʀᴘᴇɴ ᴜs.  ɪ ᴛʜɪɴᴋ ʏᴏᴜ'ᴠᴇ ʙᴇᴇɴ ʟɪᴇᴅ ᴛᴏ ғᴏʀ sᴏ ʟᴏɴɢ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ʏᴏᴜ ᴡᴏɴ'ᴛ ʀᴇᴄᴏɢɴɪᴢᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ᴛʀᴜᴛʜ ᴇᴠᴇɴ ᴡʜᴇɴ ɪᴛ ʜɪᴛs ʏᴏᴜ ɪɴ ᴛʜᴇ ғᴀᴄᴇ.  Xaden, of course, is the swooniest of swoony, and Violet is my girl. Their chemistry, my gods, is just simply ON FIRE.

R2CYZN2SLIA9JM,Writing quality and book quality were sorely lacking,"If you loved this book, I am truly happy that you enjoyed it. If you loved this book, this review is not for you.  A generous 3 stars -- Iron Flame is the talk of the town and after reading and loving Fourth Wing this past summer, I jumped back on the dragon bandwagon. But unlike many other readers, I thought this was a very disappointing read.  Compared to Fourth Wing, Iron Flame was a mere fizzle. It is a slow burn read that for me, dragged most of the way through. This massive 640-page tome was rushed to the printers to ride the Fourth Wing wave and it shows. Not only in the sad quality of my hardcover** but in the obvious neglect of proper editing.  I have no issue DNFing a book and I should have done that here, but there was so much buzz about this book, and admittedly some good twists to keep me reading, that I was hopeful that, through all the filler and whiny melodrama, there would be a great twist just around the corner. But this book needed some serious editing. The superfluous descriptions, info dumping, and underused secondary characters (Sloane, Aaric, Imogen and Cat) and the large number of tertiary characters were frustrating. I feel all these factors wasted page time that Yarros could have used to strengthen and propel her story.  Violet and Xaden seemed like different people. Their insufferable secrets from each other and the ""You didn't tell me!/You didn't ask me!"" ongoing argument was immature and frustrated me so much. Tairn, the highlight of the book, brought his awesome curmudgeonly humour once again, but I had hoped he and moody teenage Andarna would be more central to the story.  Fourth Wing was an amazing ride, but Iron Flame was a different experience for me entirely. Please know that I am in the vast minority. Many people adored this second installment of the series, I'm just not one of them. Yarros' convoluted storytelling, bouts of useless filler, unnecessary melodrama and poor pacing made this a frustrating read for me. Some of the twists and Tairn in all his grumpy glory bumped my rating up to 3 stars, but it's the marketing team that should get five stars for their ability to create such a fervor around this series. If only the writing and editing had that much attention.  ** Several greyed out, illegible pages and the plain black (no dragon) edging had already started to flake off. The quality of the printing of this book did not influence my review of the story.",1649374178,"<span>If you loved this book, I am truly happy that you enjoyed it.<br>If you loved this book, this review is not for you.<br><br>A generous 3 stars -- Iron Flame is the talk of the town and after reading and loving Fourth Wing this past summer, I jumped back on the dragon bandwagon.

The story starts quick enough from where we left off in fourth wing, I haven’t finished yet but I can’t put the book down so I might pull a all nighters here ! It did say I’d receive it the 7 but I knew it was impossible after they fixed it I received it the 9th and I don’t mind. There was no wrapping in the box I would’ve appreciated a little more protection from its lose box but the book wasn’t damaged it was just … well, not perfectly made I stumbled on ink spots on the first 5 chapters and I don’t usually see those.. granted I haven’t pre-order books before but now it makes me reconsider when I’ll do again.

R23GYG7XM66RT9,Very enjoyable book,"This book, in my opinion, made some really good progress from the first book. It better fleshed out many of the side characters, and gave reasonable explanations for the decisions of characters in the last book. Violet’s connection with her dragons were a strong pro. However, her relationship with Xaden became very grading to read about. They were either fighting or being intimate, with very few moments in between. They fought constantly over the same issues, which, didn’t really feel like issues except for (spoiler), the reveal of his second signet and the reveal of him being a venin at the end. Those two things feel less easy to forgive, but the author glossed over those quickly.

R3KFU0B8T36CBV,Story fantastic; main character hard to love,"I’ll start with the not so good.  The writing itself is little redundant and bland. Overuse of certain phrases and descriptions bugged me, and I didn’t get lost in fictional hallucinations while I read. This is really important to me, but very personal and subjective, so I didn’t include it in my reasoning for taking off a star.  That lost star was entirely how Feyre was written. Selfless, but unfoundedly self righteous. Caretaker of her family from a young age, but so immature compared to the rest of the cast. It’s not confidence, it’s arrogance. I know she’s supposed to be very young, and I’m sure I was this annoying as a teenager…But the respect and undying love she gains from other main characters by being this way - main characters with hundreds of years of life and experience behind them - really rubbed me the wrong way. I’m on book three, and the posturing and condescension from her just gets worse.  It reminds me of Twilight syndrome, where the main character is very “eh”, yet “the most beautiful, fantastical men just couldn’t help but fall in love with her”.  But reading through this series is worth it for everything else.  Though I dislike our main protagonist most chapters, everyone else is so beautifully written. Tamlin, the complex, misguided, but well-meaning (I understand this gets debatable) High Lord. Lucien, the sly, mischievous emissary who could be friends with anyone, despite the darkness in his past. Rhysand, written to be hated until you realize he’s just misunderstood and has the biggest bleeding heart. The author somehow writes everyone but the main character brilliantly, their dialogue included.  And though the story is slow to start, I would highly recommend sticking it out. When I got to the last third of the book, I couldn’t put it down until I finished it. I know I dogged on the writing, but the story itself scratches that romance-fantasy itch in ways I haven’t experienced in a very long time. Feyre’s action scenes are written so well that she’s likable to me in those moments. She becomes this fiery, noble survivor that you can’t help but root for.  Overall, I’m hooked on this series and will read it to the end. Feyre is still difficult to stomach. And maybe that’s because I’m older than “young adult” now, but it’s still worth reading for the other characters and story alone.  Granted, if anyone ever wrote a fan fiction where Nesta (a character I find has a ton of potential for growth and a more tolerable, entertaining inner dialogue) was the main character instead - I would put this down immediately just to devour that story.",1635575567,"<span>I’ll start with the not so good.<br><br>The writing itself is little redundant and bland.

R1I0025O311D89,Doesn’t deserve the hate,"Okay so... I might lost some of my favorite critics over this because I know a lot of you weren’t a fan of this book. And I have some pretty intense feelings about some of the biggest criticisms lmao. I will talk about some flaws with the book still, as no book is perfect. But for the most part I really loved it. There will be rants. I have ALOT to say. Sooo here we go before I lose my nerve lmao.  My main petty annoyance: the fact that tamlin uses his paws the same way a human uses hands even when he’s in beast form lol. There I said it. Now let’s move on to hopefully not my most controversial review ever. I feel like I’m supposed to hate MAAS and her writing. But I don’t. I really love what she did here.  Characters: Feyre: I really don’t get the hate. Maybe she gets worse later. Maybe. But people hate her in this book too and I don’t get why. She was meh to me. I admired her in some ways and hated her in others. I loved her heart, and how often she let it guide her even if it resulted in her ignoring everything anyone told her. Which yes- did annoy me sometimes. But it wasn’t that bad.  now we get to the fun part.  Tamlin and rhyes (similar thoughts on both)- Oh my god. The reasons you guys hate this dude are absurd in this book. Every single thing I was told to look out for and that would start me into hating him was ridiculous. I genuinely believe you guys just don’t ship him and feyre so that makes him immediately sooo horrible. Same for the rhyes haters.  You guys have to stop inserting in a fantasy setting and acting like any of the decisions made are simple. Both of them are great in their own way- and both had feyres interest in mind in my opinion. The questionable things they do, because yes there are some...Are either for show to SAVE feyre and everyone else. It’s all so obviously calculated and here you guys are trying to critique it like they’re events that happened over tea in a totally normal world with nothing intense or life threatening going on around them. Just why.  I’m team Rhys just because I like him a little more- and I love the way he thinks and speaks. But I also love tamlin and am still rooting for him to be happy.  I think they’re both fleshed out brilliantly and have many layers that I can’t wait to uncover. They both have scars and they BOTH have really unfortunate situations that are eating away at them that make them who they are. I’m just saying... think about the alternative that could happen if they didn’t make some of their questionable choices.  They wouldn’t have done half the stuff they did for this one human... if they didn’t truly care.  Villain-  Well she’s like not very nice lol so of course I don’t like her and I’m not rooting for her but...idk I put her here because I did kind of have a problem with how stupid she seemed to be for someone who was supposed to be cunning. She let certain people get away with way too much, and didn’t seem to notice or care. It was strange because then she would just randomly turn into a brutal witch out of nowhere but then let certain things happen other times. I’m sure some of it was her calculating but... still. It seemed a little weak.  She’s bitter, brutal and interesting. The ring, will probably haunt my nightmares. She just wasn’t as developed.  Lucien-  I don’t want him with feyre but I just wanted to say... despite me liking tam and rhyes... Lucien will forever be my babe. I love him the most. He’s so complex and he’s been through so much.  He’s witty, intelligent, and overall just cares about people even when he pretends he doesn’t. I want nothing but greatness for him lol. His story is heart breaking as well.  The rest- this story is filled with intriguing, misunderstood, and terrifying creatures. No complaints there.  Her family- feyres family is on my poop list. But I don’t hate nesta even now as some of you seem to. Maybe I’m a mean bitter person... Idk.  The plot-  Like every plot it has both weak and strong points. I loved seeing the world unfold, and getting to see a good chunk of it before the action started.  I did think the twist with the masks and how convenient all of the events were was well... convenient....while it did lead to the most exciting parts, I felt like the point of it was kinda glossed over and the explanation for why things were how they are wasn’t too important to the story.  But it came over decently- and the ending wasn’t terrible. So I’m happy.  I still got the magical yet unsettling experience I wanted. And I can’t wait to see more of this world.  I really feel like it’s just the cool thing to hate maas and these books now. But I don’t see them as problematic as a lot of people seem to. I had an incredibly enjoyable time reading them, and I saw the reasons behind the words .  Think what you want about me because of that lol. I will not defend myself for not seeing the issues other people see. I will be continuing.",1635575567,"<span>Okay so... I might lost some of my favorite critics over this because I know a lot of you weren’t a fan of this book. And I have some pretty intense feelings about some of the biggest criticisms lmao. I will talk about some flaws with the book still, as no book is perfect. But for the most part I really loved it. There will be rants. I have ALOT to say. Sooo here we go before I lose my nerve lmao.<br><br>My main petty annoyance: the fact that tamlin uses his paws the same way a human uses hands even when he’s in beast form lol. There I said it. Now let’s move on to hopefully not my most controversial review ever. I feel like I’m supposed to hate MAAS and her writing. But I don’t. I really love what she did here.<br><br>Characters:<br>Feyre:<br>I really don’t get the hate. Maybe she gets worse later. Maybe. But people hate her in this book too and I don’t get why. She was meh to me. I admired her in some ways and hated her in others. I loved her heart, and how often she let it guide her even if it resulted in her ignoring everything anyone told her. Which yes- did annoy me sometimes. But it wasn’t that bad.<br><br>now we get to the fun part.<br><br>Tamlin and rhyes (similar thoughts on both)-<br>Oh my god.

R3VK9QJS2SGVVB,Great retelling of Beauty and the beast,"Rating: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟/5  Overall Feelings: I ordered this book without the second book….or the third….or fourth…you get the picture. By the time I was a few chapters in, I ordered the entirety of the series. At first, I was a thrown a little off kilter, as you usually are when diving into a completely new book world where the first 100 pages are world building.  The beginning also gave me serious Beauty and the Beast vibes with Tamlin being so mysterious and broody, but slowly warming to Feyre. Lucien was a favorite of mine, with his snarky quips and fox-like behavior. The build to the climax that I thought was going to happen changed wildly. I love and hate that Tamlin sent Feyre home after their relationship built so much, and I pulled my hair our when she refused to say she loved him. Killed me a little inside to read that.  Then, her struggles to free Tamlin from the Queen only showed her growth more and made me love Lucien so much more also. Also….also. The twist at the end!  Overall, I cannot wait for the next book to arrive.  Characters: Feyre: She was easy for me to enjoy early on. I felt like Maas easily conveyed Feyre’s emotions, and I felt that when we meet Feyre, you can tell that she has been hardened by a rough few years. Her family has shown her little kindness despite the fact that she puts the food on the table and goes without so her sisters can enjoy the money she brings in.  Sometimes she drove me up a wall, like disobeying Tamlin and going to the Fire Night ritual…..but she met Rhysand that night, and isn’t he just delicious? However, we’ll come back to that. Feyre showed great strength and loyalty after Tamlin sent her away and she returned. I almost think that the last bit of the book where she is locked away awaiting her trials is my favorite part of the book.  Tamlin: He is a character I’m sure that the next book will show me that I was a fool to love. I was totally sucked in by his “mercy” that he showed to Feyre. I thought, “oh, how kind he is to offer her a place in his palace in exchange for Andras’ life.” Ha! What a fool! I appreciated his similarities to the Beast from Beauty and the Beast, his uncontrolled rage, his tentative romance with Feyre, and his friendship with those that are stuck in his palace.  I got more and more frustrated with him as time went on and he sat quietly by, and it seemed that Lucien was more interested in helping Feyre than Tamlin. I think Tamlin could have done a great deal more to woo Feyre and break his curse. It was also kind of meh thinking about his Fire Night ritual and how he sleeps with one Fae then turns around and expects Feyre to open up and be willing? Negative.  Lucien: I loved him. I can’t wait for his book. He was mischievous and playful. He was snide and sarcastic and just a great character. Lucien time and time again risked so much for Feyre that I almost wanted her to fall for him because he seemed like a much better character than Tamlin. Lucien “protected” Feyre from Rhysand when he burst in while they were sharing a meal.  He basically offered himself up on a platter while Feyre was facing the trials. He risked himself time and time again, saying it was on behalf of Tamlin. I don’t buy it though. Maybe a bit was on behalf of Tamlin, but I think Lucien is a better person than Tamlin.  Rysand: I mean duh. He had to be in here. I hated him at first, but I grew to love him. He’s interesting and complex. I wasn’t sure about him, but he’s obviously drawn to Feyre and did some level of protecting her during her time Under the Mountain. Was it a little self serving? Yes. However, he’s meant to be a villain….ish?  Moving on. The whole sex thing. I saw a review on amazon call this erotica……uh. Ma’am you would be horrified by actual erotica if that were the case. In any case, I don’t think they even have sex more than two or three times and it is not as exciting as some reviewers make it out to be.  I also didn’t think there was a lot of violence or language like other reviewers thought either, have you seen today’s movies and video games?",1635575567,"<span>Rating: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟/5<br><br>Overall Feelings: I ordered this book without the second book….or the third….or fourth…you get the picture.

R26LHXOLZZ1TNF,"The Beauty, the Beast and the Deranged","At the beginning I thought this would be a simple beauty and the beast reconstructed tale in fairy land. Heck for while I even thought we would have our very own Gaston trying to storm the castle and free our female lead. Thankfully Maas took us further away from the original story, and delivered a flawed but strong minded female lead. Feyra taken away to fairyland for killing a fairy in the woods, is given a chance to pursue her true passions and find love. However, as she’s learned before nothing in the human lands or fairy realm is free. As we read further into the story we realize Feyra and Tamlin our Spring Fairy Lord can never have complete happiness when under a shadow of a curse. Throughout the course of the story we find out that various courts throughout fairy land have been enslaved. Tricked to be under the control of the vengeful fairy Amarantha. While Amarantha has her reasons for attaining power, nothing justifies her continued cruelty towards the fae. May contain spoilers, key moments I hated/loved ahead:  Nesta: I was so angry at the hurtful words that she said to our heroine at the beginning. Why criticize your younger sister that is literally putting food on your table? All that anger and hate, why could she not have shown some compassion and taught Feyra to read. Still their reunion was a tearjerker for me, to learn that she was the only one to have looked for Feyra. I’m glad that all the effort our heroine took to protect her family was not completely in vain. The father though..unforgivable.  Tamlin: He has this underlying superiority complex, and it really bothered me how he criticized her as being uncultured but never truly did anything about it. Maybe he also needed to heal from the curse and having to sacrifice his soldiers, but take Rhysand as a contrast. When Rhysand found out Feyra couldn’t read, he said he would have forced her to learn in the first few months. This is where it clicked for me, Tamlin may give her what she wants but not what she truly needs. Does he really care about her or is Feyra his distraction and prize. I thought Lucian would have been a better partner for Feyra.  Rhysand: I was left with one question, is he her true mate? The shocked reaction at the end to the book was too intriguing. I must say I went back and forth with this character. I knew he wasn’t all bad, after saving her during spring fest, and saying he doesn’t remember her face (as not to have the main lead tortured). Yet, I really found it cringeworthy on having our main lead drugged and forced to make a spectacle of herself. This was cruel and maybe he selected the better option considering the circumstances, but it was dehumanizing. He will need to do some serious groveling to get back on good graces.  Lucian: Now our one eyed pirate needs a spin-off, while he takes down the Autumn court. I found him utterly charming and hoping he was the true Fae High-Lord of the spring court. He came across genuine, with his dislike for the human guest and grudging acceptance. When it comes to characters like Lucian I’m always afraid the author will kill them off, as to not be a threat to a male lead. I’m was glad he was still standing by the end of the book.  Feyra: To have learned to hunt just to feed your ungrateful family, now this is a strong female lead. Feyra is loyal and needing love and care. It broke my heart for her to still think of a family that did not respect or care for her properly. The worse was when she lashed out due to her embarrassment of being illiterate. She is more that a few letters on a page. Feyra brought color, life, loyalty, strength, and love wherever she went. I wanted her to be happy, instead she choose to enslave herself in the attempt to free Tamlin. She loved him but Rhysand and Lucian demonstrated better care. I just think Feyra confuses loyalty and gratefulness for love. I’m not sure Tamlin deserved her.",1635575567,"<span>At the beginning I thought this would be a simple beauty and the beast reconstructed tale in fairy land.

RMKJG4KVVSZZG,"Not a perfect book, but a good book 1.","I bought the trilogy. All together they were the best books I've read in a while. Separately, they were not perfect but I'm okay with that. I read a lot and tend to dislike books that show no character growth, or have wishy-washy villains, or have insta-love, or have love result from H saving h from sexual violation, or suffer from deus ex machina. I don't particularly care if something is obvious because sometimes I want to read something that is easy and obvious. My brain doesn't want to be challenged 24/7. Also, I love good dialogue- dialogue makes a romantic connection feel real rather than insta-lovey. Is dialogue action-packed? No. Does it slow down pacing? You bet. At this point, you're probably wondering where this review is going? Well, I think that knowing more about me as a reader might make it easier to see/ relate to my views for this book.  Now the fun stuff! ***SPOILERS***  Feyre (the h): This character is complex and goes through several changes throughout the series. In this book, she has her ups and downs. Initially, she is hardened, street-smart and capable with a cynical eye toward romance and happiness and outright hatred and prejudice towards the fae. She also has love for a family who seems to dislike and neglect her. She is not very likeable. But does that make a book bad? No. (Hello, Wuthering Heights.) It is, however, more rare to write an h this way because readers in general tend to want to relate to an h, particularly when it's written in 1st person perspective. So many readers might not be able to get into the story because of their dislike for Feyre. When the far remove her burdens that largely drove who she was, Feyre changes. She doesn't have a purpose to keep her going, to shape her. The pacing of the book suffers a bit here while she tries to sort herself out. She tries to make love and painting her new purposes, and while she has the determination to do so, the fit just isn't right. Does this make the book bad? No. While many people won't like to read about an h that seems somehow ""less"" this downward arc was necessary to fuel the inevitable reversal toward a more fitting purpose. It drags a bit for sure, but makes the reversal feel more right, more true later on. Did she rush into something with Tamlin. Her feelings do feel a bit rushed but ultimately fit her as a character- going all-in has always been her style from the start. In that sense, the character is consistent. Also, her reluctance to voice her love made me think that deep-down she might have confused love with gratitude. Tamlin was her savior in many ways. For all of these reasons I liked Feyre.  Tamlin (the H): Tamlin was the 1st high fae Feyre had any meaningful interactions with in the 1st book. I never really liked him as an H. He was pretty but basically hollow. He struggles with uncontrolled rage. He had just as much hatred for humans as Feyre did for fae, and his elitist attitude was hinted at throughout this book (though not substantiated until book 2). He also adheres to fae tradition in weird ways- his willing participation in the Fire Night ritual is distasteful because it borders on infidelity (especially since we later learn in book 2 that he can designate a replacement). Tamlin has from the beginning been primarily focused on Tamlin. When things get tough, he sends Feyre away; he doesn't consult or listen to her, but just decides, hinting at his desire to treat her like a possession rather than a person. When he gets a moment of freedom under the mountain he attempts to have sex with Feyre (his wants) instead of trying to escape with or save her (her needs). When Feyre is dying, he can only bring himself to beg for her life, he isn't moved into action. All of these things hint that Tamlin is not a good fit for Feyre. Many readers will not like to read about an H that is so lacking/ ill-fitted. The beautiful part is that these things are only ever hinted at in the writing, not outright stated so you will want to root for Tamlin while also feeling something inexplicably lacking in him. I thought about it lots before I picked up book 2, where my thoughts regarding Tamlin were cemented. Tamlin could not have been written more likeable though. If he was the perfect H then Feyre falling for Rhys in book 2 would have felt like a betrayal, instead of fated, and then Feyre would've been worse than unlikable but detestable as an h.  Lucian: A secondary character who is both interesting and flawed. He hates Feyre at first, but ultimately warms up to her. He is loyal to a fault, siding with Tamlin over and again, even when he thinks it is wrong to do so. A trait that becomes more obvious as the series progresses. Lucian has potential.  Rhysand (villain/other H): Rhysand was the most interesting character in the book (although Nesta was a close second). Rhys was the evil queen's right-hand man. He has done terrible things. Yet, when we meet him (not my favorite bit of the book because of the gross circumstances I do not favor, as mentioned above) there is evidence that he is not all that he seems. He appeared to be interested in Feyre romantically, but the ""why"" part is not there. Also, it is not 100% certain WHAT drives his actions. He is a mystery. Why did he decide to help her time and again? Why, if he likes her did he decide to put her through nightly humiliation? Why use her to torment Tamlin? He is clearly not 100% a good guy. He is complex.  Other things people often talk about: The sex. There is a lot more sex in this book than in other ""YA"" books. It seems like that has somehow lead to some amount of controversy. I find that notion very strange as many eons ago when I was a teen, sex was a big part of being a teen- whether or not to have it, who had it, when they had it where and how, what type of birth control to use, etc. Suggestions that a book would have any type of influence on those things are just silly. Teens have sex. It's a fact. Wishing it otherwise does nothing productive. Also, the sex in this series is not ""explicit."" Every time I see this adjective used, it makes me laugh. I have read many romances and even some erotica. If you truly want something ""explicit"" check out erotica- phrases like ""the apex of my thighs"" or the ""the length of him"" are not ""explicit."" The copious dialogue. Lots of readers don't like the extended dialogue and also wish to have seen more of the fae world. I am just guessing here, but I am thinking that they are meaning that they wanted less talk and more fairy magic. But, fae are known for more than just their magic. Another key attribute of fae has to do with their words- being able to only speak in rhyme, only speak the truth, answer any question posed, etc. This attribute can be very interesting (see Mortal Instruments series or Dresden Files). And indeed it was put to use throughout the series, sometimes well done other times much too dues ex machina for my liking. Dialogue can be a type of action when done well enough. In this book, it probably could've been better but was good enough for me.  The Fire Night and rape culture. Honestly, I am bothered by this one. I am never fond of rape or sexual violence as a plot device which is why I tend to avoid historical romances almost entirely. In this book, I think the Fire Nite ritual was used in part explain a bit about fae magic and in part to push forward the Feyre-Tamlin relationship while introducing Rhys. I think it both went too far and not far enough. Tamlin's participation cheapens his feelings toward Feyre, just imagine someone saying, ""I love you, truly, but I need to go have sex with someone else."" And then he came back to Feyre AFTER HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE, and bit her to clearly show his possession of her. It doesn't sit well, does it? Additionally, the three fae with bad intentions suggest to Feyre that fae tradition gives them the right to violate her just because she is present. That makes all fae seem brutal and detestable. Thus, it goes too far. But, what about the converse? The Fire Night ritual is supposed to be necessary to ensure the bounty of the land for the next year. But, the spring court is the only court that has/ observes this ritual en mass? That does not really make sense to me. The need for this ritual, especially considering mated bonds are a rare and extremely valued thing, is not properly explained. It really could've been omitted from the book and is one of the few things about the book that I truly did not like. The masks. Some people like them, some don't. The reason given for them was that they were yet another obstacle to a human girl falling in love with Tamlin. I really didn't mind them but I did not like Feyre's reaction to the removal of the masks. While it was consistent with her character (she always had an eye for pretty guys), I thought that it cheapened her character to have her feel relieved that Tamlin was so pretty without his mask. It was very superficial, and further proof that there wasn't much of substance to their ""love.""  While book 1 is my least favorite of the series, I still really liked it and will definitely re-read it again. Books 2 and 3 get even better and I am looking forward to further writings as well. Hopefully we will get to see what happens to Nesta, Elaine, the 6th queen, and Bryaxis.",1635575567,"<span>I bought the trilogy. All together they were the best books I've read in a while. Separately, they were not perfect but I'm okay with that. I read a lot and tend to dislike books that show no character growth, or have wishy-washy villains, or have insta-love, or have love result from H saving h from sexual violation, or suffer from deus ex machina. I don't particularly care if something is obvious because sometimes I want to read something that is easy and obvious. My brain doesn't want to be challenged 24/7. Also, I love good dialogue- dialogue makes a romantic connection feel real rather than insta-lovey. Is dialogue action-packed? No. Does it slow down pacing? You bet.

R23L305CH2KCNJ,Bow Down to the Queen of YA Fantasy,"This book, with its magic, fairytale roots, and steamy hot romance, deserves ALL of the stars. I loved it!  Here are the five reasons why I gave A Court of Thorns and Roses 5 out of 5 stars (and then some):  ★ FAIRYTALE RETELLING I was a little wary of this story when I discovered that it was a fairytale retelling. I love the story of Beauty and the Beast. Growing up, I watched the Disney version all of the time (but not as much as I watched Pocahontas). However, in the past I have struggled to find enjoyment in Beauty and the Beast retellings. Particularly Beastly by Alex Flinn -- I did not enjoy the book or the movie.  I think I was worried that A Court of Thorns and Roses wouldn't feel original, but it was the complete opposite. Maas has written an incredibly unique story that is grounded in the fairytale we all know and love, but is also independent and utter creative genius (Maas is definitely honing and owning her writing skills!). Yes, there is a curse, and magic, and a love story. But there is also dark magic, and steamy romance (and I do mean steamy!), and blood and gore, and court drama -- basically, all of my favorite things wrapped up in one neat, rose-colored bow.  There were some twists on the original story of Beauty and the Beast that I really enjoyed. For example, in the original story, the residents/servants of the Beast's home are cursed and transformed into household items. However in ACOTAR, rather than being transformed into household items, Maas' cursed characters must wear masquerade masks, and have done so for 50 years since the curse was placed on the night of a masquerade party. I also appreciated that, though Tamlin was a beast, that quality did not factor into the curse that was placed on him. Rather, as a Fae, he has the power of shape-shifting, and takes the form of a beast (usually when fighting). So, throughout most of the book, Tamlin is portrayed as a glorious, chiseled, man of steel. Some readers believe that the fact that Tamlin is gorgeous retracts from the Beauty and the ""Beast"" story line. However, no one writes hot male love interests like Sarah J. Maas, so I am not complaining about Tamlin at all.  Overall, I found that I loved the fairytale background of this story more than anything. I enjoyed drawing comparisons between Maas' story and characters, and the story I grew up with. Maas' world is so intriguing, engrossing you from the very beginning and never letting you go.  ★ GENRE While we know that ACOTAR is a fairytale retelling, that is not to say that it is a children's book. I went into this book thinking that it was Young Adult. However, there is a particular scene that takes place after the Great Rite on Fire Night (such a good scene, by the way -- just wait for it) that made me take a step back and think ""Whoa! This is way too sexy and erotic for Young Adult literature.""  Looking back at Goodreads, I found that the book was listed as Young Adult and New Adult. But, I would personally classify this book as New Adult. Having read many New Adult novels, I found that the sex rating for ACOTAR resonates with that of a New Adult novel. I think that there is a lot of confusion about the genre of this book because we all know Sarah J. Maas as a Young Adult author. I personally have no problem with this genre. However, for parents who are giving this book to their young children, or for those readers who don't enjoy sex scenes in their books -- you have been warned.  I love the New Adult genre, and discovering that ACOTAR fell into that genre made me love it even more. I appreciate the more mature content, and that the characters are closer to my age (Feyre is 19). And, hey, I appreciate the sexy times, too. (There is no shame in my game... Because, who am I kidding? I have no game.) I had also never read a New Adult Fantasy before, so I was glad to be exploring new territory.  I'm absolutely impressed with Maas as a writer. She is not afraid to be different, to venture out to new places. I love that she is entering this new genre, and look forward to seeing what else she has up her sleeve for the future.  ★ FEYRE, THE PROTAGONIST When I started reading ACOTAR, I was sure Maas was going to give us another Celaena Sardothien: a badass girl who is nearly invincible, yet lovable and cool. However, Feye (pronounced Fay-ruh) is so different from other fantasy protagonists I have read, because she is so unapologetically human. She is normal, and she is flawed, and I found that I could easily relate to her character. Feyre is unlike the female protagonists we are accustomed to. She is no fighter, not outstandingly gorgeous, and she is also illiterate (a shortcoming that embarrasses her to not end).  In the beginning, Feyre is not very likable. She is cold, harsh, stubborn, and hard-headed. But, readers begin to see how her situation of poverty has shaped her to be that way. Once at the Spring Court, where she is no longer burdened with the responsibility of taking care of her father and two sisters (all of whom are ungrateful of her efforts to keep them alive), the ice in her heart begins to melt as she lives in comfort and takes up her passion for painting. Readers witness her character develop as she begins to rediscover happiness and life's simple pleasures. Feyre easily becomes a character you can't help but root for and love.  ★ TAMLIN & AN IMPENDING LOVE TRIANGLE Since we have discussed Feyre, I believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest: Tamlin.  Tamlin is a bae Fae warrior, with magical abilities. He is also gorgeous, kind-hearted, and strong. And, he places Feyre's happiness and well-being above all else. But, he is not perfect. He is flawed, haunted by his family's past, by his own mistakes, and the lives he has taken. But, through all of that, he still strives to do and be good.  However, I admit that while I love Tamlin, I am worried that Maas has a love triangle in the works for Book 2 of ACOTAR.  Because Rhysand.  Rhys, a sexy, dangerous Fae, is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws (or rather, talons) into Feyre. And, I can't say that I hate him. I actually like his character, although we witness him do some terrible things (even to Feyre). He seems edgy, fun, and is incredibly witty. (Maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters, even the morally ambiguous ones.) While Tamlin is all gorgeous and good, Rhys has that hot-but-tragic thing going for him.  I am already struggling with the love square Maas has going on in the Throne of Glass series (between Celaena and her three love interests -- Chaol, Dorian, and Rowan). I don't think that I will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles. But, I think that as long as no one else is introduced, as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage, everything will be fine.  ★ SUPPORTING CHARACTERS While Maas' main characters are at the center of attention, her supporting characters keep this book afloat. With less focus and fewer appearances, Maas' supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the show.  First, there is Lucien, the red-haired, one-eyed Fae who is Tamlin's best friend. He is initially rude to Feyre, but eventually warms up to her. They easily develop a sort of big-brother-little-sister relationship. I would consider Lucien to be the story's comic relief. He is humorous and sarcastic and I adore his character.  There is also Amarantha, the story's evil villainess. She is a Fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans, which is not good for Feyre. She is cold, calculating, and cruel. But she has a backstory (all the best villains have backstories). And, I don't want to spoil you all, so I will just say that, when you learn her backstory, you realize why Amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving. Although, while I can sympathize with her on some level, I find her evil ways to be too much at times. However, I still find her to be an interesting, well-written character.  And of course, there is Rhysand, whom I mentioned earlier. He is incredibly important to the story of Book 1, and will have an even larger presence in Book 2. I cannot wait to learn more about his character, because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and I just know that I am going to love him.  HONORABLE MENTIONS Maas' Writing I believe that ACOTAR is Maas' at her best. As I stated earlier, we are definitely seeing Maas hone and perfect her skill -- each book she releases is always better than the last. What I liked most about Maas' writing in ACOTAR was her use of first person. Throne of Glass is written in third person, and with changing character perspectives. I find that I can tend to get bored with certain characters. But, with ACOTAR, told from Feyre's perspective, I felt engaged throughout the entire book.  Faerie World I literally want to live in Prythian, in the world of the Fae that exists beyond The Wall (just without all of the drama). Maas depicts the Spring Court so beautifully and vividly. It seems like a literal heaven on earth.  Other than the beauty of the Fae world, there are the parties and festivities. I mentioned Fire Night and the Great Rite earlier, two very interesting festivities held in the Fae world. And then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons, such as Summer Solstice and Midsummer. It is all so fantastical and fun, readers are just dying to step into the pages.  ***  There is not much else I can say about A Court of Thorns and Roses. I LOVED this book! I have no idea how I am going to wait an entire year for the sequel. It's going to be excruciating, but I am sure that it is going to worth it. Because Sarah J.

Feyre easily becomes a character you can't help but root for and love.<br><br>★ TAMLIN &amp; AN IMPENDING LOVE TRIANGLE<br>Since we have discussed Feyre, I believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest: Tamlin.<br><br>Tamlin is a bae Fae warrior, with magical abilities. He is also gorgeous, kind-hearted, and strong. And, he places Feyre's happiness and well-being above all else. But, he is not perfect. He is flawed, haunted by his family's past, by his own mistakes, and the lives he has taken. But, through all of that, he still strives to do and be good.<br><br>However, I admit that while I love Tamlin, I am worried that Maas has a love triangle in the works for Book 2 of ACOTAR.<br><br>Because Rhysand.<br><br>Rhys, a sexy, dangerous Fae, is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws (or rather, talons) into Feyre. And, I can't say that I hate him. I actually like his character, although we witness him do some terrible things (even to Feyre). He seems edgy, fun, and is incredibly witty. (Maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters, even the morally ambiguous ones.) While Tamlin is all gorgeous and good, Rhys has that hot-but-tragic thing going for him.<br><br>I am already struggling with the love square Maas has going on in the Throne of Glass series (between Celaena and her three love interests -- Chaol, Dorian, and Rowan). I don't think that I will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles. But, I think that as long as no one else is introduced, as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage, everything will be fine.<br><br>★ SUPPORTING CHARACTERS<br>While Maas' main characters are at the center of attention, her supporting characters keep this book afloat. With less focus and fewer appearances, Maas' supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the show.<br><br>First, there is Lucien, the red-haired, one-eyed Fae who is Tamlin's best friend. He is initially rude to Feyre, but eventually warms up to her. They easily develop a sort of big-brother-little-sister relationship. I would consider Lucien to be the story's comic relief. He is humorous and sarcastic and I adore his character.<br><br>There is also Amarantha, the story's evil villainess. She is a Fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans, which is not good for Feyre. She is cold, calculating, and cruel. But she has a backstory (all the best villains have backstories). And, I don't want to spoil you all, so I will just say that, when you learn her backstory, you realize why Amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving. Although, while I can sympathize with her on some level, I find her evil ways to be too much at times. However, I still find her to be an interesting, well-written character.<br><br>And of course, there is Rhysand, whom I mentioned earlier. He is incredibly important to the story of Book 1, and will have an even larger presence in Book 2. I cannot wait to learn more about his character, because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and I just know that I am going to love him.<br><br>HONORABLE MENTIONS<br>Maas' Writing<br>I believe that ACOTAR is Maas' at her best. As I stated earlier, we are definitely seeing Maas hone and perfect her skill -- each book she releases is always better than the last. What I liked most about Maas' writing in ACOTAR was her use of first person. Throne of Glass is written in third person, and with changing character perspectives. I find that I can tend to get bored with certain characters. But, with ACOTAR, told from Feyre's perspective, I felt engaged throughout the entire book.<br><br>Faerie World<br>I literally want to live in Prythian, in the world of the Fae that exists beyond The Wall (just without all of the drama). Maas depicts the Spring Court so beautifully and vividly. It seems like a literal heaven on earth.<br><br>Other than the beauty of the Fae world, there are the parties and festivities. I mentioned Fire Night and the Great Rite earlier, two very interesting festivities held in the Fae world. And then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons, such as Summer Solstice and Midsummer. It is all so fantastical and fun, readers are just dying to step into the pages.<br><br>***<br><br>There is not much else I can say about A Court of Thorns and Roses. I LOVED this book! I have no idea how I am going to wait an entire year for the sequel. It's going to be excruciating, but I am sure that it is going to worth it. Because Sarah J. Maas is a fabulous queen of writing, and every word she writes turns to gold.</span>",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23L305CH2KCNJ?ASIN=1635575567,5,False,True,451.0,us,False,10,1,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2015",2015-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,Teisha @ Girl Writes Reviews,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHRCJXN3FRUKFGYHSWYP5EFJVU6Q,AHRCJXN3FRUKFGYHSWYP5EFJVU6Q,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/8760cdea-d55c-4abb-9077-9ae8c73914cf._CR0,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg",,,,
RNXKAFDJW1G6G,ACOTAR is nothing more than erotica,"So here I sit, having gone through the OMG ACOTAR SERIES IS AMAZING phase, and out the other end, I can sit back and think ""What the actual hell?""  I'm a HUGE Maas fan, so when I found out she was writing another series, I had to have it. For the first time in a long time, my library actually got the book within a month of its release, so I checked out ACOTAR and read it in a single day. I loved it.  Books two came out, and while I was super disappointed in the pointless sex thrown in every so often and whole chapters dedicated to this nonsense, I continued reading because the story was compelling enough. And then ACOWAR emerged, and everything changed.  This was a series I read numerous times before ACOWAR came out, and I saw things that genuinely bothered me, but I ignored them (I don't even know why) until I just couldn't stand it anymore.  ACOTAR is nothing more than erotica. I feel like the series as a whole started out with plans of being some sort of ""story"" porn that has a kick-ass plot with ""hot"" scenes thrown in for whatever reason, and then it got to ACOWAR and decided it wanted to be The Bachelor or a soap opera instead.  The relationship between Tamlin and Feyre GREATLY disturbs me. She's taking care of her family and he swoops in after she accidentally kills a fae (who was disguised as a wolf int he woods where hunters hunt...) and takes her away, claiming she's going to be in trouble and damned and blah blah. No, she's pampered and given servants and pretty clothes and good food. Tamlin dresses her up like a doll and makes snide remarks when she falls short of his goals (fae goals, mind you).  Feyre is a HUMAN. Tamlin is fae. He acts like her humanity is a curse or something to hold against her, and he constantly makes remarks about how she's too fragile, too uneducated, too plain, etc. Instead of ""fixing"" these issues, Tamlin does nothing other than tell her what to do and not do.  He sexually assaults her after Calanmai, and in the book Feyre shows how much she does not want his advances, and he shoves her against the wall and BITES her, then tells her not to ever go against him again. How is this OK? If my husband ever did this to me, I'd kick him in the crotch and leave. This is not OK. This is not a relationship. This is abuse, which is why it disgusts me that people go on and on about Tamlin.  The fact that Feyre and Tamlin have sex at a later time after he did this makes it worse. why, Feyre, are you going to throw yourself at a man who A) Doesn't care about you based off his degrading comments and B) threatens you. Not only that, he basically blames her for a near-rape experience when he literally did nothing to look out for her and/or stop the guys who were going to attack her?  That being said, I have a lot of issues with Feyre. She gets off too easy on everything, and it's like her brain is only wired to care if the dude is hot. You take care of your family, but then you walk into Tamlin's embrace after the things he has said and done. I understand she has been abused by this, but at the same time, she could have said no. Death is a lot better than basically being a sex slave or punching bag to an immortal person determined to imprison you until you die.  She's never punished for killing a fae. Lucien and Tamlin tell her about magical creatures that could give her what she wants, and the next day she walks out and finds them...the elusive creatures...that are hard for fae to find?  Lucien is about the only well developed character, and he's too sexualized sometimes for me to take me seriously. If you keep pointing out the abs, tanned skin, or whatever on the dude, you're turning them into a slab of meat. All of the males, and truthfully the females as well, in ACOTAR are ""perfect"" in the idea of what today's society thinks is beauty, sexy, and amazing at everything. This is sexist on every account. Your characters become nothing more than fantasies--which is why I say this is nothing more than porn/erotica.  Sure, you can get some great messages out of this series, but is it worth all of the dung in the way? Specifically with the later books, there's too much sex at some points for it to even be OK. Please, go try to have sex that many times or for days on end and tell me how that is. if you can do that, I'm sorry, but you're either a whore or you're just kinda crazy, because that's too much.  Why I ever read this book and like it, I truthfully don't know, but I'm done with this series. I'm done with this fandom, and I'm fed up with seeing people ""swoon"" or make comments or even draw/like at that nude art about LITERARY CHARACTERS. Guys, seriously? This is not a book for young girls, but when I went to the first (and last) Maas event, most of the audience there were between the ages of 14-20 (predominately 15-17 years of age) and SCREAMED when Maas was mentioning SEX SCENES. I'm not going to continue to support a series that is encouraging young teens and young women to have unrealistic ideas of men as well as sexual fantasies, especially the married women who I've seen act this same way. if I were your husband, I wouldn't be able to deal with that. I wouldn't want those books in my house.  About the only good thing I have to say for ACOTAR was that there actually was a plot in this book, and it was good, if insanely slow to get rolling, and the amount of sex was fairly minimal.",1635575567,"<span>So here I sit, having gone through the OMG ACOTAR SERIES IS AMAZING phase, and out the other end, I can sit back and think ""What the actual hell?""<br><br>I'm a HUGE Maas fan, so when I found out she was writing another series, I had to have it.

R3HIAWZ5MBRM3T,ஐBeauty and the Beast meets Faerie ஐ,"ஐBeauty and the Beast meets Faerie ஐ – I should ADORE this but overall it was just okay. There are things I totally loved about this story, but they are marred by the things that didn’t quite work out for me and so what I’m left with is feeling in the middle where I didn’t love it but I didn’t hate it either.  I’m a huge fan of beauty and the beast retellings or most fairytales actually, but Belle is my absolute favorite heroine because she is smart, reads and doesn’t fall head over heels for the first pretty face that happens along. She and I could totally be BFFs. Then there is the Fae. Now I’m not a big expert on faerie stories or anything like that, but I find the Fae to be totally interesting creatures and usually like it when they are incorporated into stories. Instead if this being a magical mashup that made the story soar to new heights of awesome I found myself seeing some serious sour notes that disjointed the story and made it feel clunky.  The stuff I totally LOVED –  ✧ - Tamlin and his Faerie world - There are some really interesting descriptions of the time spent at the his manor. The lake full of starlight, the manor, the art and his court cursed to all be in masks. Tamlin is completely likable right from the near beginning.  ✧Lucien – He is a spunky guy full of vim and vinegar that Fayre has a lot of fun verbally sparring with and getting into general trouble. He is also a great friend to Tamlin and I love the brotherly bound between them. While Lucien has an easy way with people he is working hard to help his friend find the right way to woo Fayre.  ✧ The Love Story – I enjoyed the time Tamlin and Feyre were getting to know each other and the tentative flirting the best. I really wish there was maybe just a little more time spent on it as it was the basis for the last 40% of the book.  “My father once told me that I should let my sisters imagine a better life—a better world. And I told him that there was no such thing.” I ran my thumb over his mouth, marveling, and shook my head. “I never understood—because I couldn’t … couldn’t believe that it was even possible.” I swallowed, lowering my hand. “Until now.”  ✧ The ‘Tasks’ – I like the idea behind completing some challenges to prove your worth and love. I liked even more that it was Feyre The Girl who had to do this instead of prince charming. It was a nice twist to a normal Fairytale.  ✧ - The Curse – while not particularly a fan of the fact the curse made Tamlin and his court all have to wear masks (since I really thought it would have been better if they all had to remain in animal form) I did like the final symmetry and cruelty of the curse. It was different and I totally respect that, it was a truly Fae curse in the level of cruelty behind it.  ✧ Rhysand – was my FAVORITE CHARACTER and I’ll totally admit I’m still not sure what exactly I think of him. I will say this though, he is the most interesting character in the book whether he is playing on the side of good or evil….well you will have to make your own decision on that. But I seriously hoping the next book is about him.  As this is the start of a new series I will give it some leeway at getting started. There are some really fun parts to the story and even though it is a bit clunky at times I still got to a point when they are ‘Under the Mountain’ that I needed to get through the story to see how it all worked out and this is where the story mostly stayed on the like side of the line.  The stuff that missed the mark:  ✦ - When writing about a well-established lore I think there are some things that perhaps the reader will ‘accept’ or ‘not accept’ based on how important or ingrained it is OR the story the author puts with the lore change. Based on my various readings there are a few things about fantasy creatures that are ingrained into me. I KNOW that  ➜ Vampires – Drink blood, Can’t be in the sun and die by a wooden stake through the heart ➜ Werewolves – Silver bullets, Shifting (of some kind), Full Moon ➜ Fae – Immortal Tricksters, CAN’T LIE ➜ Zombie – Human dead, eat flesh  I’m not going to say the Maas changed the Fae lore so much that she *Stephanie Meyer’d* it but she pretty much made a change to the Fae lore equivalent to making vampires sparkle in the sunlight. It isn’t quite a deal breaker for me, but I’m not a fan of that particular lore twist either.  ✦ It pains me to say this but Feyre and I didn’t get along until about 75% of the way through the book. She does so many stupid things that honestly I went from really liking her in the very beginning of the story to being completely annoyed with her.  She began strong and independent with a family to support and I really liked that she wasn’t your typical virgin heroine. She hunted for her family and was the main supporter. Not conventionally educated she still came across as bright and strong.  After ending up in Tamlin’s court and promising to stay the first thing Feyre tries to do is escape, when Tamlin assures her that he has seen to her family’s comfort she pouts and tries to find a way to escape again. She puts herself in dangerous situations without much thought in these attempts and really it was slightly tiresome.  “Weren’t you warned to keep your wits about you?” Tamlin snapped. “That your human senses would betray you?” He stepped beyond me and let out a snarl so vicious that whatever the thing was by the gates shimmered with light and darted out as fast as lightning streaking through the dark. “Fool,” he said to me, turning. “If you’re ever going to run away, at least do it in the daytime.”  I liked her a little more after she calmed down and decided to stay but the damage was done and she never made much headway with me again until toward the very end of the book when she became much more likable.  ✦The Curse –( Yes I know that it is up in the like part as well, you get +5 points because you noticed) - The story made it seem like it was so horrible to be cursed to wear the masks but honestly I thought it made Tamlin hotter instead of diminished. Masks are sexy I don’t care who you are just think about it Zorro, Phantom of the Opera, a slew of superheroes AND….The Dread Pirate Roberts  Tamlin had a beast form so I thought it would have worked possibly better if she had to fall in love with only his personality. Just an opinion.  ✦The ‘Rite’ – There is a moment in the book where there is a spring festival. I’m not a prude I swear but it really bothered me how that played out. The whole scene made me feel a little strange and I really wasn’t sure what to do with my feelings about it. Maybe if I knew some other Fae stories and knew that was what ‘The Rite’ of spring was I wouldn’t have minded but I was not prepared. On a good note I was happy that it didn’t have any negative residual affects between Feyre and Tamlin.  Overall Thoughts:  Sometimes at the beginning of a new series you can’t see the big picture and that is why the first book of it might fall a little flat for you. I will say that when I read Throne of Glass it was just an okay book for me as well but then I loved both Crown of Midnight and Heir of Fire. I’m hoping that is also the case with this series.  Based on how the book ended I have some really high hopes for the next book of this series. If you like fairytale retellings or Faerie stories then I say still give this one a go. If anyone can deliver a stronger second book to a series it is Maas so I’m not concerned and think she could be off to a solid start.  Begs Sarah J. Maas to have the next book be about Rhysand and dare I hope for it..….Nesta",1635575567,"<span>ஐBeauty and the Beast meets Faerie ஐ – I should ADORE this but overall it was just okay.

I KNOW that<br><br>➜ Vampires – Drink blood, Can’t be in the sun and die by a wooden stake through the heart<br>➜ Werewolves – Silver bullets, Shifting (of some kind), Full Moon<br>➜ Fae – Immortal Tricksters, CAN’T LIE<br>➜ Zombie – Human dead, eat flesh<br><br>I’m not going to say the Maas changed the Fae lore so much that she *Stephanie Meyer’d* it but she pretty much made a change to the Fae lore equivalent to making vampires sparkle in the sunlight. It isn’t quite a deal breaker for me, but I’m not a fan of that particular lore twist either.<br><br>✦ It pains me to say this but Feyre and I didn’t get along until about 75% of the way through the book. She does so many stupid things that honestly I went from really liking her in the very beginning of the story to being completely annoyed with her.<br><br>She began strong and independent with a family to support and I really liked that she wasn’t your typical virgin heroine. She hunted for her family and was the main supporter. Not conventionally educated she still came across as bright and strong.<br><br>After ending up in Tamlin’s court and promising to stay the first thing Feyre tries to do is escape, when Tamlin assures her that he has seen to her family’s comfort she pouts and tries to find a way to escape again. She puts herself in dangerous situations without much thought in these attempts and really it was slightly tiresome.<br><br>“Weren’t you warned to keep your wits about you?” Tamlin snapped. “That your human senses would betray you?”<br>He stepped beyond me and let out a snarl so vicious that whatever the thing was by the gates shimmered with light and darted out as fast as lightning streaking through the dark. “Fool,” he said to me, turning. “If you’re ever going to run away, at least do it in the daytime.”<br><br>I liked her a little more after she calmed down and decided to stay but the damage was done and she never made much headway with me again until toward the very end of the book when she became much more likable.<br><br>✦The Curse –( Yes I know that it is up in the like part as well, you get +5 points because you noticed) - The story made it seem like it was so horrible to be cursed to wear the masks but honestly I thought it made Tamlin hotter instead of diminished. Masks are sexy I don’t care who you are just think about it Zorro, Phantom of the Opera, a slew of superheroes AND….The Dread Pirate Roberts<br><br>Tamlin had a beast form so I thought it would have worked possibly better if she had to fall in love with only his personality. Just an opinion.<br><br>✦The ‘Rite’ – There is a moment in the book where there is a spring festival. I’m not a prude I swear but it really bothered me how that played out. The whole scene made me feel a little strange and I really wasn’t sure what to do with my feelings about it. Maybe if I knew some other Fae stories and knew that was what ‘The Rite’ of spring was I wouldn’t have minded but I was not prepared. On a good note I was happy that it didn’t have any negative residual affects between Feyre and Tamlin.<br><br>Overall Thoughts:<br><br>Sometimes at the beginning of a new series you can’t see the big picture and that is why the first book of it might fall a little flat for you. I will say that when I read Throne of Glass it was just an okay book for me as well but then I loved both Crown of Midnight and Heir of Fire. I’m hoping that is also the case with this series.<br><br>Based on how the book ended I have some really high hopes for the next book of this series. If you like fairytale retellings or Faerie stories then I say still give this one a go. If anyone can deliver a stronger second book to a series it is Maas so I’m not concerned and think she could be off to a solid start.<br><br>Begs Sarah J. Maas to have the next book be about Rhysand and dare I hope for it..….Nesta</span>",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3HIAWZ5MBRM3T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1635575567,3,False,True,109.0,us,False,3,2,"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2015",2015-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,Robin Snyder,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLX434YT5VYRRJZIONOCQN2BJHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AGLX434YT5VYRRJZIONOCQN2BJHQ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/2ce3e241-cded-48c5-a183-625cf791de35._CR0,0,2545,2545_SX48_.jpg",,,,
R3I2BLGYLVK3AQ,Beautiful Cover,"Having heard much raving about this series, I was poking around on Amazon when I saw this collector's edition. It is indeed gorgeous, although I do wish it had a ribbon attached to the book to use for a bookmark. The gold image that flows from the front cover to the back and the texture of the cover are far more appealing than the plain, paper, black covers that are on most hardbacks today, and that alone justifies its presence on the shelf. It wasn't the first time I had bought a book for the cover.  Aside from hearing reviews from fans, I also saw a reference to the book when reading about Patricia A McKillip's _Winter Rose_, which I had recently read, and its connection to the ballad of Tam Lin. This same fairy tale apparently had influence on Holly Black's _Tithe_, also. Although the High Lord in Maas's tale is named Tamlin, the story is obviously a retelling of ""Beauty and the Beast."" The story also has borrowed pages from the fairy tale ""East of the Sun, West of the Moon,"" wherein the main character is taken away from her family by the bear, and the bear prince makes her impoverished family rich. Whereas neither ""Beauty and the Beast"" nor ""East of the Sun, West of the Moon"" have fairy characters, aside from a witch or enchantress here and there, in the story Tam Lin, he is identified as an elf. In Maas's retelling, which court is cursed to wear masks, Tamlin's friend's mask is clearly stated as a fox, whereas Tamlin's mask is only vaguely described, and he is often referred to as a ""beast."" The lack of description was a tad infuriating.  While set in a fairy tale period of time past, the main character clearly has ""modern"" ideas. She has no mother and a weak father figure and, furthermore, was tasked by her dying mother to take care of her sisters, despite the fact that she is the youngest. The family has only recently fallen into poverty, and the main character's upbringing has been neglected. She learns to hunt to feed the family, and, unlike the book-loving Belle of the Disney fairy tale, no one bothers to teach her how to read, although she is presented with a library, at which point, if you were ever in doubt as to which fairy tale was being emulated, you now know for sure. According to the Internet, the character's name ""Feyre"" means ""Fair, Beautiful,"" like the name ""Belle."" DYSWSDT? I myself am not a fan of retellings, and even less of ""modern"" retellings, although I do appreciate influences and notes here and there.  As a novel, the story has a single plot line. I have always felt that a story can be a single plot line told in a linear fashion, but a novel requires a bit more substance. Although it was interesting enough for me to finish, I am not sure that I feel compelled to read the rest of the series, particularly if there is no matching collector's edition. For me, the most interesting parts were the three tasks at the end, and I had already guessed the answer to the riddle. I found Feyre's modernity and rebellion to be tiresome and in direct contrast to what readers who like fairy tales would desire, and I found her difficult to like, which is basically how I feel about most ""strong female characters."" I do not understand how a person who is stubborn and illogical is strong. Stubborn, I can get. Stubborn and dumb at the same time? No.  ACOTAR has a Lexile score of 880, which puts it at the lower end of a 4th grade reading level (700-1160). You won't learn any new big words, and the prose is clearly more commercial than literary and follows the ""hero's journey"" template little to no deviation (i.e., no big surprises). It is known near the beginning of the book that the main character is no virgin, and there are racy scenes past the middle of the book, as well as being intoxicated and hints of something like a lap dance while being scantily clad in later chapters. The descriptions of the fairy land (not merely a realm) were not as detailed as those in Julie Kagawa's _The Iron Fey_ series and were mundane and too similar to the lands of the mortals. The writing was a bit awkward at several points where one character's actions were in the same paragraph with another character's dialogue, so there was a bit of a whiplash effect for the reader, and the book could have used a good editor to clean up those areas. So, was it bad? Obviously not that bad, since I finished it. Will I read more of her stories? I can't say for sure, but probably not unless they issue an attractive collector's edition worthy of the bookshelf. It satisfied my curiosity, but for Fey-related books, I recommend Jim Butcher's Dresden Series and Julie Kagawa's Iron Fey Series. Both have mind-blowing descriptions and intricacies. I'm always interested to read other authors and series that would do a better job on this topic just to see if it's possible.

R24QI1TXOPGU04,Easy to read,"While I generally enjoyed the story and kept reading on and on, it has certain deficiencies that I cannot disregard. 1) I enjoyed the basic storyline - human girl taken to the fairy world, having to surpass trials to save her love, using elements from mythology, also great references that are not so obvious to everyone. 2) The writing was not very well done. It fell into the fallacy of telling instead of showing. There are a lot of looming questions in the first part of the book, and instead of making a puzzle for the reader, we get a full chapter where a side character just simply explains everything. The story itself was interesting, but this set up robbed me from exploring this myself. I got half a book of a main character who annoyingly didn't try to ask any questions, and then this one chapter pouring all the answers. Another issue was that I, as a reader, did not fall in love with Tamlin. There was simply no chance for that. His true personality is not shown in the book. There are chapters where he just talks with Lucien, and says some strange things to Feyre, and then boom, they are bathing together in the river, and we are supposed to feel in love. I didn't. I didn't get anything that made me fall in love with Tamlin. There are no conversations with him that would show his personality. 3) Feyre, the main character was annoying. She just blindly accepted anything that came in front of her. I only read the first book so far, so this maybe important to her character arc. But still, someone who had to fight for the life of her family, she just went with everything that happened to her. Has to go to fairy land? OK. Has to go home? OK. Older sister says to go back? OK.

R3OYBANMC45BX6,"A sexy fairy tale with a sweeping, epic scope","Read more: http://www.sarcasmandlemons.com/2015/06/review-court-of-thorns-and-roses-by.html  in short  It seemed fitting to post my review of ACOTAR during Something Strange and Deadly week, given that Sarah and Sue are uber-besties. I will preface by saying: I have a huge blind spot when it comes to Sarah Maas. There were bits of this book that might have bugged me more if it had been another author. That said, ACOTAR stands solidly on its own. It's older than Throne of Glass, more mature, but without traipsing into drug store romance territory. The whole atmosphere is ridiculous with magic and fairy gorgeousness. You enter the world and immediately are steeped in its legends. You meet Feyre, a sharp-tongued badass who taught herself archery to feed her family. She's a firebrand and I love her. One wrong move has her whisked away to faerie-land to live with Tamlin, sizzlingly handsome faerie Lord and certified mental eye-candy. The relationship between them heats up slowly and burns bright. But there's a darkness as well, a plot that threatens both of their worlds. I wish that the evil part of the plot had been more prominent and taken up more space; I also found the ending turn a little eye-rolly. However, I still gobbled it up. ACOTAR transported me as a good fantasy should, and left me impatient for more.  in depth  in this loose beauty and the beast retelling, Meet Feyre. Once a gentlewoman until her family's fortune was lost, she now lives with her father and two sisters in a quaint cottage. She's the definition of fierce. With her father a self-made invalid, her proud and idle sister Nesta, and her naive and lazy sister Elain, she's the family's sole hope. She's scrabbled her way from starvation to survival, teaching herself to use a bow, to trade, to adapt. So she's smart enough to recognize a fae when she sees one, and to kill it. In a twist on the original tale, it's Feyre whose crime has brought doom, and she is given a choice: death, or life in the faerie realm, away from all she's ever known. Obviously, she chooses the non-dead version. She's brought to a magical castle where the Beast's curse is reimagined: masks that can never be removed, and a sickness in his magic.  there are hearts at stake, It's a little less obvious why Tamlin might need a girl than the Beast, but stick with it. You'll be rewarded with a sweet, slow-moving romance. I'll admit: I found Tamlin a little boring. He's broody, tortured, and has some magical rage issues that beg a nuanced dialogue around healthy relationships. I preferred Lucien, who's witty and petulant. But in the end, I came to appreciate Tamlin's kind and gentle nature. His romance with Feyre is built on a rocky beginning; she hates and fears him, and longs for escape. But of course, they come to know each other more deeply, to appreciate each other's quirks and passions. I'd have liked more conversations between them, but we do get plenty of steaminess. And I'll say it: I usually find sex scenes laughable, but Maas avoids ridiculous euphemisms and actually gives her steamy scenes some emotional power. In other news, I'm hoping that the Rhys thing doesn't become a triangle thing, because unbalanced power dynamics aren't sexy.  but also the fate of a magical world. Alas, the lovers cannot be in peace, for there is a curse upon the Courts of the faerie land. Magic is becoming weaker and more unpredictable. Dangerous creatures lurk beyond their borders, creatures that feed on fear and soul. It soon becomes clear that the land is being corrupted from within--and its collapse could mean devastation for mankind. Feyre isn't complacent. She's reckless, for sure, but she's determined to find out what Tamlin can't tell her. Along the way she meets Rhys, a seductively wicked fae lord who may be her aid--for a price. Her curiosity leads her into a twisted game of intrigue, revenge, and evil. It's a thrilling mystery that kept me on my toes. It all leads up to a do-or-die moment, when Feyre must show her own power and become a savior.  there are a few instances of flimsiness. I did have my issues. ACOTAR didn't feel as tightly plotted as Throne of Glass. Some of the character motivations seemed flimsy. There were also few positive female characters--at least not any who stuck around for more than a few pages. I really wanted more of Nesta and Elain, particularly as Nesta was so dynamic across the plot. The villain, in particular, came off flat. Not to mention a couple moments of victim blaming that made me squirmy. But my main disappointment was with the trials Fayre faces to save Tamlin. They were so freaking cool, but they came towards the end of the book. As a result, they felt rushed and I felt skeptical that so much had been accomplished so soon. Fayre does have a habit of doing crazy things that should probably kill her. But maybe the most frown-worthy part involved a riddle. I guessed the answer within the first two lines, so the final reveal was more meh than gasp-worthy.  even so, sharp and atmospherically written, Despite these missteps, ACOTAR is a fabulous example of craft. Maas' writing has always had a fairy tale quality to it; that's used to advantage here, where everything she describes seems extra mystical and chilling. She's concocted a fabulous fantasy world. Her fae are old gods, held back from ruling humanity only by an ancient treaty. They live within seven courts--such as Dawn, Summer, and Night--that tensely coexist. For some reason, I really geeked out about the courts. It felt like a detail ripped from Grimm, but all Maas. This is also a dangerous world, and I would have liked to see more of it. There are nightmare creatures who lure you in with their seductive telepathy, goblins and ghouls, man-eating monsters who foretell the future. It's a fairy land with a deliciously dark edge.  it's the new adult we've all craved and deserved. I usually avoid new adult. I have it on good faith that they're all much the same. College girl meets boy. Hatred. Brooding. Sexy times. OMGLOVERAINBOWS. It's just stupid. But many adult books deal with marriage and kids, things I can't yet relate to. So it's about freaking time that new adult diversified, just as young adult has done. With ACOTAR, you get all the steam and romance, but you also get an exciting adventure story. I can only hope that Maas' success will pave the way for other NA with actual plots.  in a sentence  A Court of Thorns and Roses is a fairy tale with the volume turned up: more dangerous, more romantic, more seductive.

She wasn’t a rich entitled girl going to a fae court, but a strong willed girl who had suffered. She is not the character that you would expect the book to be about when you first start it.

RBKFHGBRVV823,4.5 stars- AMAZING. spoilers ahead,"I haven’t sat down and read a non-mystery novel in a long time. I haven’t sought out or enjoyed a first person romantic isekai-adjacent stuff in FAR far longer. It had all the energy, love, and quality of the page turner Young Adult books that I used to devour, but with older characters that I could see myself in, even nearly 13 years out of high school, visceral language that was only seemingly allowed to be found in a few books in the latter half of the series I grew up with, and like….. of course the steamy scenes, but the way they were peppered in felt so real, so wonderful, like the smooth lighting of a candle. And the final act????? The final act????? I could see it happen in the inner theater of my brain. The worm. The tattoo. The pleading in their eyes. It made my stomach clench. My heart beat faster. And the end was very satisfying. Above all else, yes, there were moments of toying w plot armor, and there were times that I almost called deus ex machina, but Maas just danced with the ideas, flirted with the Mary Sue heroine of old. She showed, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you CAN have a hero who is human, a hero who makes mistakes, a hero that will win in the end of this book without the reader even for a SECOND thinking she didn’t deserve it, didn’t earn it. And she didn’t do it alone. She didn’t have to. Her kindness that shows through the wall she’s had to put up, her ability to see to people’s hearts, her charming recklessness, how could they NOT have done a “power of love” moment and all come together to save her? I just. Bravo. The more I think about this story, I love it even more.  The only reason I removed the half star was I think the drugging thing was… a lot, especially since I suspect he is going to become a love interest in a triangle for Feyre. It felt sort of…. Defended? Which was??? Mmmmm??? But genuinely I do not want to pass full full judgment and change my opinion of the book as a whole beyond the ~ick~ and gut feeling of what Rhys’ look at the end meant.  -Sam",1635575567,"<span>I haven’t sat down and read a non-mystery novel in a long time.

R2YFUHYOQ4IN7B,An imperfect love - but I still read in twice in 48 hours!,"Read more of my thoughts about this book and others here: http://bluedollarbill.blogspot.com/2015/05/time-for-another-book-review.html  This is what I get for reading so much YA fantasy, I suppose, instead of legit grown-up literary stuff. Most of the time, it doesn't quite live up to my expectations, but then when it exceeds them, it's just extraordinary. It's always a pleasure to lose yourself in another world, and it's a kind of exquisite joy to marvel at the flexibility and grace of someone else's imagination. Like watching a rhythmic gymnast.  For a change of pace, I read Sarah J. Maas' A Court of Thorn and Roses, which I had preordered, based on my love for her Throne of Glass series and my fondness for the story of Tam Lin. Let's talk about Throne of Glass for a minute: Maas has a fairly cool story. She started writing this series as Queen of Glass on FictionPress when she was a teenager and finally got it published many years (and many revisions) later. It's supposed to be a riff on Cinderella, but only in the sense that Cinderella is the fairy tale that set the author's imagination wandering. The first book, Throne of Glass, grew on me. As a YA fantasy writer, Maas is not Laini Taylor or Maggie Stiefvater. Her sentences don't echo in my head, over and over, like a favorite song. But there is a delight to her characters and their relationships to each other, a sense of humor, sarcasm, witty, good-natured ribbing that washes over the reader like a cup of hot chocolate. Her characters (like Stiefvater's) feel like old friends. Her main character is a girl, an assassin, a voracious reader, who loves music, candy, and beautiful gowns, and manages to be both selfless and self-centered, able to revel to luxury and capable of surviving anything. It doesn't always quite add up - if you pause for too long - but stay immersed in Maas' world and it works.  Also, they wear really awesome clothes. Maas uses Pinterest to good effect - the women, especially, are breathtakingly dressed and she does a fabulous job describing the fashion. On the downside, she does clearly have particular turns of phrase and descriptors she loves to use, and a LOT of people wear clothes that are ""simple but obviously of very fine make."" It's repetitious, yes, but mostly it just makes me jealous - why can't I find basic, high-quality clothes like white linen shirts that fit me flawlessly and ""supple leather"" boots than mold to my feet? (Cuyana, please make a few more things. And make the fit a little less unisex. Please.)  For the most part, the plot of Throne of Glass (so far - there are three books out in a six- or seven-book series) works and the twists and turns are intriguing and satisfying. The back story is impressively well-developed. (It's so well-developed, in fact, that I hesitate to return to writing my own novel out of fear that I don't have the imagination to pull it off. Like J.K. Rowling, even the smallest details and introduction of apparently minor characters has major relevance for the plot.) There is a major plot hole in the second book - something that really never makes sense - but it's possible to overlook it and jump back into the flow of the story. Do you ever do that? Simply choose to pretend that your favorite author didn't actually mean what they wrote? As long the rest of the story makes sense without the problematic element, I do - all the time. Often, the problematic element is an illogical explanation for a supporting character's actions and I can imagine into place a more logical one. I reserve my greatest agonizing for books that are beautifully set up, with elegant words and fascinating characters, but where the illogical element ruins all the downstream events and the book collapses like a house of cards.  Where are the editors, I wonder? I should be editing these books.  A Court of Thorns and Roses doesn't quite collapse but it's on shaky ground. The main character never has the depth of the protagonist from Throne of Glass. She's less outlandish and yet less fully realized too - she seems like a mashup of Cinderella and Katniss from The Hunger Games. Both she and the male protagonist are so reserved and laconic that it's rather hard to get to know them, as the reader. That's okay - she still does a better job than most. I think magic is hard to work with, in a story - authors really have to know what the rules are, or readers will question why anything happens the way it does. The rules are perhaps not quite as well-defined in Court of Thorns and Roses as I'd like, but the real problem in the logic comes only in the last quarter of the book. (That's probably why I enjoyed it as much as I did.) Essentially, the last quarter introduces an intriguing antagonist of questionable loyalties but his loyalties aren't quite questionable enough - it's a mystery why the main antagonist lets him get away with playing for both sides as much as he does. Alas, when I'm faced with that kind of mystery, I usually conclude that the author knew where she wanted her story to go and didn't spend enough time thinking through how to get from point A to point B. And then I blame the editor for not being objective enough to see the problem. Because, at least in this case, it could have been written in a way that was more believable, less dependent on luck. And I would have liked it a lot more.  The second problem is harder to describe without spoilers and, indeed, a long explanation of the plot. Essentially, it has to do with why one of the main characters is himself an obstacle to his own romance (which drives much of the plot). The reason makes sense, after the reader has spent some time thinking about it and turning it over and over in her mind. The problem is that the bits and pieces provided by the first-person limited narrator are barely sufficient to realize why he acts as does - and not sufficient to make it wholly believable. Does that make sense? Without nuance, if I were to summarize the plot for someone, this aspect of the plot, of character development and motivation, would make sense and seem quite powerful; but the book needed more richness and detail in this regard to make it ""real on paper.""  Of course, NONE of this means that I'm not going to pre-order the next book in the trilogy (and mark the date on my calendar) as soon as it's available.",1635575567,"<span>Read more of my thoughts about this book and others here: http://bluedollarbill.blogspot.com/2015/05/time-for-another-book-review.html<br><br>This is what I get for reading so much YA fantasy, I suppose, instead of legit grown-up literary stuff.

R1B8HFCJFF2G3M,Totally Captivating!!,"Wow! It has been a LONG time since I have actually felt tension while reading a book. I can read the biggest action scenes at the end of various books and the majority of the time they just don't affect me at all - because I don't care that much about the characters. But THIS - this was different. I felt the tension. And it was real. Plus the author is very willing to kill characters so there is some uncertainty there as well. And the battle at the end of this most excellent book - it was hot and raging. Plus the enemy leaked danger as well. True menace. Very rarely does some enemy in a book impress me at all but this one most certainly did.. Right from the description I just KNEW there was something different about these mages called venin. They seemed impressive too. And very memorable. I wanted to draw them based off of the description. Very rarely do I get that urge.  But what a battle at the end! It was touch and go. What would happen? Would the heroes win or lose? I didn't know. And I felt concern.  This book has made me feel things. Earlier it had made me cry - tears of joy.  And the book has surprised me too. The plot twists! I guess I should have seen it coming but I didn't so I was quite surprised. But it certainly makes the story way more interesting! And I am certainly eager to read the sequel too! This is a massive book and worth reading every word! And rarely do I feel that way. But its exciting and the characters face so many challenges. And there is death too. In fact there is a lot of death in here. Its a very violent world, a tough world of dragons and griffins and things that are supposed to be only legends to scare kids to eat their vegetables...  But what I love the most in here in the main character Violet. She has a connective tissue disorder. I have one too (its called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - EDS - and I am pretty confident that Violet actually has EDS). I have never run across a character in a book before that has EDS. And certainly not one that is bold enough to be in a fantasy world where she rides a dragon. How cool is that? So yes I certainly can relate to her very well! And so much of the stuff in here is quite accurate too. Exercise is the best way to protect the joints (and personally I find diet matters a ton too). And yes it certainly can make many things way harder. The joints are all wonky and they naturally hyper-extend so doing things - even just balancing - is way harder. But riding a dragon!!! I remember when I was much younger I used to read this other very popular fantasy series that included dragons and I used to try to imagine what it would be like to ride a dragon. Of course I never thought about the issues of staying ON said dragon... But since I ride horses these days I have a better idea of some of the issues. But wow this book is totally AMAZING! it totally captivated my attention. The first evening I started it I got 50% through. And I certainly would have powered through the second half yesterday but unfortunately I have packing to do as I am moving at the end of the month.  If I could I would rate it 6 stars!  The characters are just so real. And they go through character arcs too. They change. They face obstacles and have to find solutions. And there is certainly a bit of romance in here too. The story moved so smoothly. Never a dull moment at all. None. And I just loved the first person writing in here from Violet's viewpoint.  But the story is about a young woman named Violet who has been forced by her very powerful mother to become a dragon rider. That is a warrior. But her body is weak and ill suited for it. So she was training to be a scribe (but all of that writing would be a huge strain on her too - in fact I cannot write very long at all by hand anymore without pain + numbness going down my arm and I get horrid shoulder pain) but that changed - she had to go be a dragon rider or die trying. But its not that easy in fact its very dangerous. Most people who try to become a rider end up dead. And you can be killed by your own classmates! Yes, its a very brutal school. And after all of these difficult obstacles - which Violet is ill suited to pass - she has to hope that a dragon will pick her. But what dragon will pick someone with a body that doesn't work right due to genetic mutations?  And all of that is near the beginning of the book! For a huge mysterious and dangerous problem is brewing in the Kingdom! And poor Violet will run smack into it - err - fly into it. If she can stay on the dragon that is...  You definitely should read this!",1649374046,"<span>Wow! It has been a LONG time since I have actually felt tension while reading a book.

So yes I certainly can relate to her very well! And so much of the stuff in here is quite accurate too. Exercise is the best way to protect the joints (and personally I find diet matters a ton too). And yes it certainly can make many things way harder. The joints are all wonky and they naturally hyper-extend so doing things - even just balancing - is way harder. But riding a dragon!!! I remember when I was much younger I used to read this other very popular fantasy series that included dragons and I used to try to imagine what it would be like to ride a dragon. Of course I never thought about the issues of staying ON said dragon... But since I ride horses these days I have a better idea of some of the issues. But wow this book is totally AMAZING! it totally captivated my attention. The first evening I started it I got 50% through. And I certainly would have powered through the second half yesterday but unfortunately I have packing to do as I am moving at the end of the month.<br><br>If I could I would rate it 6 stars!<br><br>The characters are just so real. And they go through character arcs too. They change. They face obstacles and have to find solutions. And there is certainly a bit of romance in here too. The story moved so smoothly. Never a dull moment at all. None. And I just loved the first person writing in here from Violet's viewpoint.<br><br>But the story is about a young woman named Violet who has been forced by her very powerful mother to become a dragon rider. That is a warrior. But her body is weak and ill suited for it. So she was training to be a scribe (but all of that writing would be a huge strain on her too - in fact I cannot write very long at all by hand anymore without pain + numbness going down my arm and I get horrid shoulder pain) but that changed - she had to go be a dragon rider or die trying. But its not that easy in fact its very dangerous. Most people who try to become a rider end up dead. And you can be killed by your own classmates! Yes, its a very brutal school. And after all of these difficult obstacles - which Violet is ill suited to pass - she has to hope that a dragon will pick her. But what dragon will pick someone with a body that doesn't work right due to genetic mutations?<br><br>And all of that is near the beginning of the book! For a huge mysterious and dangerous problem is brewing in the Kingdom! And poor Violet will run smack into it - err - fly into it. If she can stay on the dragon that is...<br><br>You definitely should read this!</span>",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1B8HFCJFF2G3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1649374046,5,False,True,133.0,us,False,2,1,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024",2024-01-10T00:00:00.000Z,Sarah B,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEEEZK55D4Y2KTHYKL6FAMXZ4ROQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AEEEZK55D4Y2KTHYKL6FAMXZ4ROQ,,,,,
R2UJ7TCPZKYSSY,Lords of Discipline + Dragonriders of Pern + ...steamy romance? But it works!,"I first came across Fourth Wing when I noticed it in the #1 position on Amazon's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2023 So Far. But beyond that selection, I looked at how the reviews were trending. At the time, there were more than 21,000 reviews (it's now about to crest 40,000), and the average was a whopping 4.8 stars. It has to be good for that many people to love it, right? In need of a palate cleanser after the difficult read that was The Whispers, I decided I'd limit the likelihood of another clunker and see what all the hype is about. And I'm happy to say that I get why so many people love this book: it's pretty great.  Fourth Wing is set at Basgiath War College in the mythical land of Navarre. It opens on Conscription Day, where thousands of twenty-year-olds assemble to take their place among the healers, scribes, or infantry. The most elite of them try to join the most selective branch and become dragon riders.  Our heroine is Violet Sorrengail. Bookish and smart, yet frail, she always imagined a future as a scribe, just as her father had been. But her mother is a rider and a general in the army, and she has other ideas. Against Violet's wishes, her mother insists she attempt to be a rider as well. But this isn't an idle push in a different direction. The stakes are the highest possible for those trying to become riders: from the opening conscription challenge through bonding with a dragon, there are dozens of opportunities to fail, and any failure when attempting to become a rider equals death.  In addition to the general peril of the tasks at hand, there is also a ruthlessness among the members of the War College. Fewer classmates means better opportunities to bond a dragon, and so the murder of fellow classmates, while perhaps not encouraged, is certainly allowed, making every waking moment one filled with potential death. Yarros creates an interesting caste within the college of students who carry ""rebellion relics"". They are the children of adults involved in a rebellious uprising six years prior. All of the adults were executed, and the children were only spared execution as well by being forced into conscription as riders. As a result, they all tend to possess a brooding darkness -- you could think of them as the ""Slytherin"" of Basgiath. To further complicate things for Violet, those children of the rebels all intensely hate her because Violet's mother was responsible for ordering their parents' execution.  The novel is packed with a ton of genre-bending elements. There is the basic plot -- Violet's unlikely journey through her first year at Basgiath War College -- which stirred up memories of one of my all-time favorite books, Pat Conroy's The Lords of Discipline, based on Conroy's first year at The Citadel military college. There are dragons and dragon riders, which of course evokes memories of plenty of fantasy novels, with Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series top of mind. And then there's some romance, and a potential love triangle, which starts out feeling like something from a YA novel, but ends up a lot more R-rated and steamy, and more akin to what you might find in a novel with Fabio on the cover. Add to this a nuanced backstory and some misdirection on who the reader should trust and believe, and Fourth Wing truly has something for everyone.  There is depth to the story and characters, which elevates the story and I'm sure plays a big role in the stellar reviews. Yarros handles relationships well, whether it's the strained relationship between Violet and her mother, the love between Violet and her sister, or the friendships Violet forges with her classmates. The romance is the romance; honestly I could have done without it, and while it was almost humorous at times, it works for what it is meant to be. Yarros also does a standout job of presenting how her characters handle loss. Whether it's grieving the loss of family members or their classmates, there is an undercurrent of sadness and longing that affects many of the characters and hardens them to the task at hand. Despite the intensity of their training, Yarros does a pretty good job reminding us that they're only in their early twenties and still figuring out a lot of life.  I suspect a lot of the hype and enjoyment of the book is related to how Yarros turns a straightforward ""year 1 as a student story"" into something more. I can't help but compare that to the Harry Potter books (except, of course, Harry never had hot magical sex with Ginny Weasley -- at least not within the pages of any of the books!). Those novels changed significantly for me with the third book in the series, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Where books 1 and 2 were decent and straightforward YA novels, The Prisoner of Azkaban took the story to a more nuanced and mature level. Yarros does the same thing here, but all within the pages of a single book. I get why people are so drawn to the story.  Overall, it's a winner. It's fun, and while it feels derivative of several other novels, it also combines those stories and plots in its own unique way. Book 2, Iron Flame, is already set for release this November (I've already ordered my copy!), and so if you fall in love with the characters, you'll have the opportunity to spend more time with them before long (well, at least with those who survive Fourth Wing). It's a compelling read and like the other 40,000+ readers who have this trending at almost 5 stars, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",1649374046,"<span>I first came across Fourth Wing when I noticed it in the #1 position on Amazon's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2023 So Far.

R3TAV4YKSC6WNU,Could not put it down,"This is a well-written, easily-read, highly-entertaining book with an engaging storyline, relatable characters, a believable heroine, and excellent pacing. From the first page it is clear this was a book written by an experienced author and professionally edited, something one can no longer take for granted with Amazon's self-publishing service. I raced through this book and Book 2, the Iron Flame, in under a week, simply unable to tear myself away from either one. I highly recommend them both and can't wait for book 3. The genre is this new amalgam of romance and sword & sorcery fantasy which seems to be rapidly growing in popularity. The sex scenes may be a bit too explicit for younger teens, depending on your sensibilities as a parent, but were tamer than another well-known author in the genre who tends to go overboard. There's also violence and swearing, but nothing beyond what any older teen hasn't already been exposed to in today's culture. And although I loved both books, the amateur book critic in me found two small, very nitpicky flaws worth mentioning. Both books end on cliffhangers, and while that is common when writing a series, the giants in the field (LOTR and Harry Potter) did a better job of wrapping up each individual book as a separate storyline. The other thing was the author's strange choice of changing the perspective in the last chapter of both books. Both book are first-person narratives from the perspective of the heroine/protagonist. Then the last chapters of each book switch to first-person narratives from the perspective of the second main character. I found this an odd and jarring choice that I hope she abandons for subsequent books (Ms. Yarros, are you listening?) This secondary main character's internal dialogue sounds no different from the protagonist's, and it comes off as gimmicky and frankly confusing. Those minor critiques aside, these are two fantastic books that I hope spawn many more, and I highly recommend them.",1649374046,"<span>This is a well-written, easily-read, highly-entertaining book with an engaging storyline, relatable characters, a believable heroine, and excellent pacing.

R3MEF4E0PC0ZWZ,A Captivating Romantic Fantasy That Builds to an Enthralling Crescendo,"Fourth Wing is a well-written and immersive romantic fantasy novel that slowly but surely draws you into its intricate world and compelling character dynamics. While the pacing may test some readers' patience initially, those who stick with it will be rewarded with a captivating and steamy narrative that leaves you eager for the next installment.  The book's greatest strength lies in its rich worldbuilding and detailed lore surrounding the various celestial beings and their intricate societies. The author's vivid descriptions and attention to detail make it easy to become fully invested in this fantastical realm, where good, evil, and other mythical creatures coexist in a delicate balance of power and desire.  The romantic aspects of the story, while slow to unfold, are skillfully crafted and genuinely engaging once they take center stage. The chemistry between the central characters is palpable, and their interactions sizzle with an intensity that will undoubtedly satisfy fans of the romantasy genre. The author's ability to build tension and anticipation pays off in spades during the latter portions of the book, delivering scenes that are both steamy and emotionally resonant.  However, it's worth noting that the narrative does take its time establishing the world and character dynamics before diving into the more overtly romantic elements. Some readers may find the initial pacing a bit too leisurely, wishing for a more expedited journey to the spicier aspects of the story. That said, the patient buildup ultimately enhances the payoff, making the eventual romantic encounters feel earned and all the more impactful.  Despite the slower start, ""Fourth Wing"" manages to build momentum and excitement as it progresses, culminating in a gripping finale that leaves you craving more. The last quarter of the book is an absolute page-turner, filled with unexpected twists, sizzling encounters, and tantalizing hints of what's to come in the next installment of the series.  Overall, ""Fourth Wing"" is a well-crafted and engaging romantic fantasy that rewards patient readers with a richly imagined world and a tantalizing love story that builds to an enthralling crescendo. While some may wish for a brisker pace early on, the payoff is undeniably satisfying, making this a solid entry in the romantasy genre and a promising start to an intriguing new series.",1649374046,"<span>Fourth Wing is a well-written and immersive romantic fantasy novel that slowly but surely draws you into its intricate world and compelling character dynamics.

R3MHMIODOJ2LQJ,"Epic, breathtaking and consumed my every thought","Fourth Wing was epic, breathtaking and consumed my every thought. This is easily one of my top favorite books, ever. This book had me screaming from excitement, gasping from betrayal, and crying all the happy and sad tears. Foreshadowing of what was to come was secretly laced into the pages, leaving us with the feeling of dread that was all consuming. The betrayals cut deep. The friendships were beautiful. The enemies to lovers romance was a slow burn that was passionate and steamy. And the battles were intense and epic. If you love romantasy, you definitely need this one on your tbr!  Violet Sorrengail is one of my favorite heroines. She was smart, cunning and brave. She was so easy to connect to and feel all of her emotions. She thought she was destined to enter the Scribe Quadrant, but her mother changed her future. As the commanding general, her mother forced Violet to go to the Basgiath War College. And there she would either survive and become a dragon rider or die trying like countless others. The trials she went through were gutting, and I found myself cheering out loud for her every step of the way! Violet is a heroine that you can respect and love!  Xanden Riorson was someone that was so easy to obsess over. He was Violet's enemy, because his parents had a rebellion that went against Violet's mom. In punishment, he and the other children of those who rebelled had to attend the Basgiarth War College. Yet by the end of Chapter 7 I was definitely betraying Violet, I was obsessed. Xaden was smart, sly and seemed honorable. His subtle banter with Violet was EVERYTHING! So when Violet would follow through with one his suggestions for training, I was grinning from ear to ear. And when he taught her how to grapple on the mats, it was so hot *fans face*. It seemed like Xaden was trying to protect Violet, yet in her world deception and backstabbing were done without a second thought. So while I was under his spell, I still didn't know whether I could trust him or not. I kept whispering for him not to betray her.  This world was fascinating! Maybe I was putting the clues together wrong, but it seemed like not everything was as black and white as Violet was taught. All the while, others around her elicited so many emotions. It was terrifying not knowing who you could trust. There were those who had no problem killing a threat, or just killing for fun. Even the grappling was intense, and I was shocked with my mouth left hanging open over how that would play out. Broken bones were the least of your concerns. So as people showed their true colors over time, some of that made my blood simmer. But at the same time, be careful who you get attached to. Death found some of them too soon. One especially I still can't handle, even after finishing this book *sobs*.  The dragons in this book were larger than life! I can't say much, because of spoilers, but the conversations and interactions were spellbinding. Also I loved the friendships that were formed between the humans. They were the type of friendships where you knew they would do anything to protect your life. Which is desperately needed since life and death moments were always present. Throughout this story, there was always this charge in the air that left me terrified of what was to come. And it was impossible not to have sweaty palms during some of the scenes or to feel your heart pounding in your chest! Plus the twists and turns were done beautifully! Some of it I saw coming, but others left me with my mind blown!  With the most epic of last lines, this book left us at the perfect spot where we can breathe. For a bit. Yet you'll still be left desperately wanting to grab that next one! With emotions and tensions running high, this was an action packed ride! The dragons, sparring, battles, political intrigue, friendships, and scorching hot and seductive scenes made this book beyond memorable. It had my whole heart in the palm of its hand and made me cry all the tears! Fourth Wing was beyond addictive and will easily become a favorite for romantasy fans!

R16DLQ9D6WKS2G,Amazing and riveting!,"10/5 stars The world building, pace of the story, and characters were all amazing. Moments of hilarity in between moments of plot.

I had serious rage levels every time he would try to step in to protect Violet or opened his mouth.  I have been so invested in a story in such a long time, but this book gripped me by the shoulders and yanked me inside. Violet and Xaden‘s story developed in a way that I could see happening, but not anticipate how it would go. Finish the story in a day and a half, because I couldn’t put it down!

R1B8QV3CJCLJ0Z,I can’t believe I waited so long to read this epic book,"Guys. I’m not lying here: 2023 is MY YEAR for reading. I cannot tell you how many books I’ve read that have been so astonishingly beautiful and amazing and overall top tier. This novel is no exception.  Coming into this book, I wasn’t sure what to expect. The only other book I’ve read by Rebecca Yarros is The Things We Leave Unfinished. Also amazing, but if you’ve read it you know it’s on a completely different playing field than this book. I mean, Fourth Wing is on a different world and isn’t a historical romance novel. It is epic, though, and I’m not using that word lightly.  Fourth Wing is a fantasy novel set in the world of Navarre where dragons, griffins, and magic are real. If you’ve followed a majority of my reviews on my blog, you know that I hardly ever review fantasy novels. I honestly think the only other fantasy novel I’ve reviewed was The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, which honestly was a real world fantasy, so wasn’t that far outside of my realm. With that being said, this book is outside of my typical comfort zone but holy hell did I love it. Now I’m thinking I’ve been missing out on all of these amazing fantasy novels and I might just go on a binge.  So, what exactly did I like about this novel? Everything. But to break it down: the world building that went into writing this is absolutely insane and makes it an amazing read in itself; the characters that don’t necessarily make you think “oh this again” with the main heroine; the unbeatable plot; and the beautiful, comical writing style that Rebecca Yarros demonstrates.  The world building speaks for itself, but the characters that don’t follow typical patterns particularly made me like this novel. For instance, our main heroine, Violet, is way weaker than other riders. She doesn’t fit the mould. While this is typical for our main character, what follows isn’t. Instead of her beating all odds and becoming the strongest rider of all, she basically just… adjusts. She has to do things differently and doesn’t just become a natural born rider. It’s amazing and you’ll know what I’m talking about if you’ve read the book.  The plot is just like what I said: unbeatable. You have foreshadowing, a romantic subplot, tension and high stakes throughout the entire novel, and man is it satisfying. I’m not sure how long this series is going to be, but I am here for it.  Lastly, Rebecca Yarros’ writing style in this novel is nothing short of spectacular. You get epic battle scenes, romantic moments that play with your heart, and comical snips that make you laugh out loud. It really does have everything and I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire novel.  Overall, this review is huge but I had a lot to say. I honestly can’t even point to something that I disliked about this novel, which just goes to show you how much I loved it and how great I think it is. If you enjoy fantasy novels, you’ll fall in love with this book. If you don’t enjoy fantasy novels? You’ll still fall in love with this book. I’ve already recommended it to my book club, my mom, and my brother. Y’all are welcome.  Favorite quote: “And when others are quick to stand in front of me, Xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold my own.”",1649374046,"<span>Guys.

RMLG5BBD2CJAQ,I NEED THE SEQUEL RIGHT MEOW!,"John Palladino, author of the grimdark fantasy series, The Tragedy of Cedain, picked this book for me to read. He said he'd heard a lot of people say good things about it, but the people he trusted absolutely hated it. He wanted to know what I thought. So here we are.  What do I think? I started this book and became obsessed. For the three days it took me to read it, I was either curled up in my chair physically reading it or suffering through the audiobook when I had to actually get up and function as an adult.  I would recommend reading this one physically, if possible. I had the good fortune to land both FOURTH WING and IRON FLAME in hardback during a sale in recent months. As is my habit, I checked out the audiobook from my library so that I could pair the two together. Rebecca Soler is the narrator and I did not enjoy her narration at all. Well - there is one exception - during certain scenes, Soler did match the pacing of the scene with her narration, and infused it with emotion that I felt truly captured the intensity of the moment. So there's that.  I loved so many of the characters in this story. Even though the book description warned me that the only way to leave this war college was to graduate or die, I still fell in love with these kids and rooted for them to conquer each challenge faced and survive to the end. It may surprise you fantasy readers out there to know that I favored the human characters over the dragons in this book. Don't get me wrong - the dragons were magnificent and I loved learning the little bits of history they shared and most especially loved learning about their magic and how it changed, based on their chosen Rider. It's been two days since I finished the book and I'm still in the horrible throes of a book hangover. (Thank goodness I already have the next book on hand to start soon!)  What I loved most about FOURTH WING was the setting. Even though there were a few deaths - one in particular - that devastated me, I wouldn't change a thing. This war college where young adults enter with the intent to become a Dragon Rider had a staggeringly low success rate. First, you have to survive the entrance to the Rider Quadrant. If you successfully navigated that, you were officially a cadet. Cadets then began their first year of training where they must survive challenges, training, education, fellow students and even the dragons! Just because you completed everything to a point, the dragons could reject you. (Hopefully by simply ignoring you and not with fire)  I was engrossed with the magic that was bestowed upon the Riders from their dragons. The dragons were able to channel magic through their bond to the Rider and the abilities manifested in different ways, depending on the Rider. Who the Rider was at their core - the kind of person they were - matched their magical abilities. I know the magic in this book was just brushing the surface, so I'm looking forward to continuing the series to see how it continues to build and seeing if the Riders' magic evolves further.  Obviously, this is a fantasy romance, so I feel like I should mention my opinion on the love story between our main characters. I liked it! It felt like the type of romance a couple of young 20-somethings would have, especially in a setting where they literally might not survive the day. It was quick, full of fire and flat out consuming. So many rant reviews I've seen focus on the ""horny dragons"" - I'm confused why people picked out that one scene that only took up a couple pages and what happened between the dragons took place off the page. I mean, how else do you think baby dragons get made?  In closing, I had a great time with this book and CANNOT wait to get started on the sequel. I'm at war with myself because I want to read it immediately, but then I also want to wait a bit closer to when the next book releases in early 2025.

R1LETQO4R3K7IR,4.5 Stars,"One Sunday, I was visiting blogs, which I don't get to do very often, and stumbled upon one that caught my eye. I can't remember the exact wording, but the blogger stated they didn't enjoy a book that was getting a ton of buzz and love. However she worded her comments piqued my interest, so I looked up the book on Goodreads and decided almost instantly that it sounded like something I would like. I added it to my wish list, and Husband bought it for me for my birthday. I still put off reading it for a while because I needed to focus on review books first. I finally found time to pick it up, and I have to say that I didn't want to put Fourth Wing down. We never have lazy days where we just let the kids watch TV all day, but Husband wasn't feeling well, it was 101 degrees outside, and I was enthralled. So I read every chance I got that first day and read about 80% by midnight. I needed to sleep because I knew that was too much to finish at a reasonable time for me. And I finished the other 20% the next day.  Fourth Wing has everything you could want from the first release in a new fantasy series. You have a flawed leading character--Violet is fragile. Her bones break easily, her joints and ligaments are weak as well. She is short. And generally not physically strong. She is, however, brilliantly intelligent. She spent her entire life training to go to the scribe quadrant. But her mother, one of the nation's top military leaders, decrees that Violet will enter the dragon rider's quadrant instead.  The rider's quadrant is a vicious school of tests and challenges that will end with more cadets dead than alive. Often times the tests kill the cadets. Just as often, the other cadets will do the killing. And what deaths remain are likely from the dragons themselves! Unique schools like this are why series like Harry Potter, Vampire Academy, Divergent, Red Rising, and even Throne of Glass have been wildly popular and universally loved.  And I mean dragons! The appeal of these mythological creatures is fascinating. Perhaps because they're imaginary, we love the different iterations of dragons throughout various literature and media. Fourth Wing's dragons are some of the best I've come across, from the varieties and their discerning qualities to their ability and willingness to bond to humans. Plus, the bond enables a psychic connection with their riders. These dragons are so well done. I applaud Rebecca Yarros for her imagination and vivid depictions in bringing them all to life.  The friends are an interesting variety as well. There are friendships that form almost instantly, those that have spanned entire lifetimes, those that form unexpectedly, and even ones that form begrudgingly. The personalities differ as much as the dragons and the abilities they bestow upon their riders. Violet's older sister, Mira, warns her against forming friendships in the rider's quadrant. Allies are important, but friendship can often be a liability. Plus, when cadets are dying more frequently than surviving, forming friendships means saying goodbye to people who have shared pieces of their hearts with you and vice versa. But Violet doesn't survive the rider's quadrant by following the path others have established. She must survive by her own instincts and her own journey through the tests and trials.  Speaking of abilities, Rebecca Yarros also did an excellent job creating a wide range of abilities since there are so many different characters. None of the signets were too similar to each other. And I loved the intrigue of wondering what new talent would be gifted to the next cadet. She even forms opposite sides of a coin without it appearing to be mirror talents.  The enemies were fierce. We start off with Violet being warned by her sister Mira to steer clear of Xaden Riorson because he will kill her as soon as he gets the chance as revenge for what her mother did to his father in executing the king's justice for his father's rebellion. Violet meets him almost immediately. Nearly the same time, a brutal new cadet sets his sights on her as an easy target to weed out the weak links. Only Violet embarrasses the new cadet, and he swears revenge that he will kill her. And he's not the only person she ticks off during her first year. Xaden is hard to read. He forces Violet into his wing since he's a wingleader. He bounces back and forth between giving her advice that will help her survive, ignoring her completely, and sending others to her in ways that could be construed either for or against her.  Of course, the driving questions are about whether Violet will survive each challenge she's faced with. If she does, will a dragon want to bond with her? At least until you get to a point where you have answers to these questions, and then you want to know what will happen next. I can't reveal those questions to you as they'd be spoilers.  Favorite quotes: -""They choose for reasons they don't see fit to share with us."" He pushes off his desk. ""And not all strength is physical, Violet.""  -You are not attracted to toxic men, I remind myself...  I had to laugh at that one.  -""One does not live a century without being well aware of the space one takes up.""  -""Justice is not always merciful.""  -""I know you just want to keep me safe,...,""I whisper. ""But keeping me safe is also keeping me from growing, too.""  -""I will hate you for this."" ""Yeah."" He nods, a flash of pure regret crossing his face as he draws away. ""I can live with that.""  -""Andarna is my favorite.""  -""You can ride me when the flesh rots off my bones, wingleader.""  -""Whatever you feel is natural. Allow yourself to feel it, but then let it go.""  -""...if we let fear kill whatever this is between us, then we don't deserve it.""  -""One generation to change the text. One generation to choose to teach that text. The next grows, and the lie becomes history.""  I was so disheartened when I finished Fourth Wing and went to go purchase Iron Flame only to find that it wasn't released yet. The unique school setting where the cadets die more often than survive. The friends. The enemies. The romance. The DRAGONS. All of it was exactly what I look for in a series. Now, I will say that once the characters leave the setting of the school and undoubtedly have to face the corrupt government, things have the potential to go south like series such as Divergent and The Hunger Games. We shall see if The Empyrean series can survive the traps that other series before it fell into or will it thrive similar to series like Red Rising and Throne of Glass. That being said, Fourth Wing gets 4.5 Stars. Have you read Fourth Wing? What did you think?

Allow yourself to feel it, but then let it go.""<br><br>-""...if we let fear kill whatever this is between us, then we don't deserve it.""<br><br>-""One generation to change the text. One generation to choose to teach that text. The next grows, and the lie becomes history.""<br><br>I was so disheartened when I finished Fourth Wing and went to go purchase Iron Flame only to find that it wasn't released yet. The unique school setting where the cadets die more often than survive. The friends. The enemies. The romance. The DRAGONS. All of it was exactly what I look for in a series. Now, I will say that once the characters leave the setting of the school and undoubtedly have to face the corrupt government, things have the potential to go south like series such as Divergent and The Hunger Games. We shall see if The Empyrean series can survive the traps that other series before it fell into or will it thrive similar to series like Red Rising and Throne of Glass. That being said, Fourth Wing gets 4.5 Stars. Have you read Fourth Wing? What did you think?

I didn't know it needed actual pictures to go in it though so he had to give it to him with none in it because we didn't have time to have any printed off before Christmas because it was a last minute find. No big deal really but I don't recall it saying anything about that in the description. Wish I had known. My boyfriend loved it and it will definitely be a treasure he will love forever.

R2TZZ6TRWD82UK,"""Mastering the Game of Power: A Captivating Journey Through 'The 48 Laws of Power' by Robert Greene""","""The 48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene is a compelling and thought-provoking book that delves into the dynamics of power and influence in various aspects of life. Here's my review:  Robert Greene's ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is a fascinating exploration of the strategies, tactics, and principles that underlie the acquisition and maintenance of power. Drawing from historical examples, anecdotes, and timeless wisdom, Greene presents 48 laws that illuminate the intricate dynamics of power dynamics in relationships, politics, business, and personal interactions.  One of the strengths of the book is its rich and diverse range of historical and contemporary examples, which illustrate each law in action. Greene's storytelling prowess brings these laws to life, making them relatable and memorable for readers. Additionally, the concise and accessible writing style makes the book engaging and easy to digest, despite its dense subject matter.  Each law is accompanied by practical insights and advice on how to apply it in various contexts, whether in navigating office politics, negotiating deals, or managing interpersonal relationships. While some laws may seem Machiavellian or morally ambiguous, Greene emphasizes the importance of understanding power dynamics for both self-protection and achieving one's goals.  However, it's essential for readers to approach the book with critical thinking and discernment, as blindly adhering to the laws without considering ethical implications can lead to harmful outcomes. Greene himself acknowledges the potential for misuse of power and encourages readers to use the laws responsibly and ethically.  Overall, ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is a compelling and illuminating read that offers valuable insights into human behavior, social dynamics, and the nature of power. Whether you're a business leader, aspiring entrepreneur, or curious individual seeking to understand the world of power and influence, this book provides a wealth of knowledge and wisdom to ponder and apply in your own life.  I highly recommend ""The 48 Laws of Power"" to anyone interested in psychology, sociology, leadership, or personal development. It's a timeless classic that continues to resonate with readers worldwide, offering timeless lessons on navigating the complexities of power in today's world.",0140280197,"<span>""The 48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene is a compelling and thought-provoking book that delves into the dynamics of power and influence in various aspects of life.

R1NE5WR09W5AN2,Not For The Faint of Heart,"For those who consider ""The 48 Laws of Power"" an ominous guide, they are perceiving it through a misguided lens. This book serves as an essential tool, guiding individuals on how to protect themselves against the perilous influence of negative, deceitful, and potentially harmful individuals. The book's structure is ingeniously designed, with each law being accompanied by real historical anecdotes of transgressions or observances. These tales are nothing short of gripping and immersive, often featuring infamous leaders and influencers. Additionally, the author meticulously presents an interpretation, providing a profound understanding of each law, which is further enriched by revisiting the accompanying story. The book culminates with an impactful image, a distinguished authority's quote, and a decisive reversal, altogether reinforcing the reasons that validate the adherence to these laws. After reading, it is pertinent to meticulously reflect on personal experiences, offering a vital source for wisdom and resilience, as this book is not to be taken lightly. Reflection and prudence are paramount to the application of these laws.  The purpose of reflection and caution is an essential component of mastering the insight offered by 'The 48 Laws of Power'. Highlighting key words and impactful quotes not only solidifies their significance but also serves as a mental anchor in navigating various situations. It encourages a retrospective examination of personal experiences, intricately weaving the wisdom gleaned from these laws with one's own encounters.

The book emphasizes the ardent need for delicacy and discernment when applying these laws, cautioning against reckless usage.  The power found within ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is not to be taken lightly. It certainly isn't a mere instructional guide to unleash upon the world. It serves as a stern warning, advising extreme caution. Each law demands careful consideration and offers a double-edged sword, capable of causing harm if misused. The book's purpose is not to manipulate or control people at whim, but instead serves as a tool for protection against those who intend to harm.

R3CRIGYGYX3UAZ,DANGER: read at your own risk,"there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book, so if you are curious but unsure, this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book, and how it will impact you  First, to understand the 48 laws of power, you must know two key ideas 1. you CAN NOT escape the power game. thinking you can ""not participate"" is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still. Robert Greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples 2. the 48 laws of power are neither good nor evil; they are just LAWS. If someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise? This is the mindset you must adopt in order to learn a lot from this book.  Things I Liked - NEW PARADIGM after reading the 48 laws, you will never see the world the same way again. once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before. - INCREASES POWER one of the main reasons to buy the book. you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these laws -CRYSTAL CLEAR every law is clearly outlined with ""transgression"" of the law, ""observance"" of the law, keys to power, and a ""reversal"" -GREAT STORIES the 48 laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws. this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstract.  What I didn't like  -RISKY an old proverb says "" A man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten"". If you begin to use the 48 Laws improperly, you could get yourself in some dangerous situations, lose friends, piss off a lot a people, and destroy relationships - REQUIRES DISCERNMENT if you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says ""do xyz and you will accomplish vyx"" look elsewhere. the Laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and apply -NOT FOR EVERYONE If you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with caution.  OVERALL: If you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do, you should definitely read the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. If you want to be naive, easily manipulated, weak, you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilx.

R2T7FQFYADXMO7,A Thought-Provoking Journey on Power-Dynamics,"As a curious mind always seeking to understand diverse perspectives, Greene provided an intriguing exploration into the intricacies of power dynamics. The book delves into historical examples and offers a unique perspective on strategies people have employed throughout history to gain and wield power.  One particularly fascinating aspect is Law 6: ""Court Attention at All Costs."" Greene emphasizes the importance of being the center of attention, and indeed, the book has courted attention, but not without consequences. The attention it has drawn has sparked discussions about morality, ethics, and the impact of its teachings on individuals and society, even in this very forum of the review section!  What makes this book noteworthy is the unintended irony that emerges from the critical reviews. Law 6, which advocates for seeking attention, inadvertently led to a different kind of attention. Readers express moral concerns and disappointment, creating a thought-provoking dynamic between the author's intent and the readers' reactions.  Even the critical reviews on Amazon, reflecting a divergence of values and expectations, ironically breach the principle of Law 6. The attention garnered is not universally positive; instead, it becomes a stage for moral debates and reflections on the societal implications of the book. A beautiful example of Law 6 playing out in real-time.  In conclusion, ""The 48 Laws of Power"" serves as a captivating exploration of historical power dynamics, sparking conversations that extend beyond its pages. The unintended consequences and the divergence of opinions only add layers to the complexity of power, making it a thought-provoking read for those who appreciate examining contrasting perspectives.  Read it not once, not twice, but multiple times. Immerse yourself in narratives, absorb the nuances of each law. Write them down, recite them aloud, recall them - Apply them!  Keep the Laws close, not just as a set of rules, but as a source of introspection, and a catalyst for critical thinking. Let the book serve as a catalyst for personal growth and understanding.",0140280197,"<span>As a curious mind always seeking to understand diverse perspectives, Greene provided an intriguing exploration into the intricacies of power dynamics.

R3D92RYO0EH83V,Survive and Thrive In a Competitve World,"I picked this book up for $1, proof that there is no correlation between cost and value.  This would be the book that Machievelli would have written, had he courted the Aristocracy of his times, rather than attempting to ingratiate the Prince.  The author gives a hint to his motivations for this composition when he states in his acknowledgments:  ""Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipulate, torture and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for supplying me with the inspiration for the 48 Laws of Power.""  This book is cathartic. But before diving deeper, a reader should be prepared to entertain the following ideas:  1. A Human being is no more than a sophisticated animal with self-interest as the primary motivator 2. Everyone wants more power, not less 3. Be true to yourself first and foremost, don't be a sucker 4. Power is a game and the better you play, the better your life will be 5. Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to acquire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil 6. To triumph, it is necessary alternate between being both cunning and formless 7. Beyond linear dualities of good and evil, there is a third dimension, the strategists' mind 8. The indirect path, that of influence is more effective and the use of it is an art  If you can live with the above, the 48 laws of power serves as a handbook on the arts of indirection.  This book argues that by mastering ones emotions, understanding the people involved and the fundamental dynamics of interrelationships within society determine the extent of ones accomplishments. Power is ultimately an artificial construct, given legitimacy by the people who participate in the game.  We need power to survive in a competitive world that is constantly seeking to recruit us into the ambitions of others. We can drain our lives in the fulfillment of others, or best use our given life, energy and talents at our own discretion. Implicit to this design is the belief that society defaults a role to you, whether or not that role reflects your beliefs and understanding about yourself. A choice then has to be made on your part to accept such a role or to resist whether in an active or passive way. In the latter sense, one will turn upon themselves. It is better then to assert some degree of control by exercising influence and demonstrating an identity that is consistent with the person whom we feel ourselves to be, in other words, to actualize ones' self. Although this end state transcends any particular identification, characterization or ego, the path to it requires a struggle and this book is about the methods and devices used by successful participants. The good news is, the struggle can be worthwhile, rewarding and the unexpected consequences enlightening.  The perfect archetypical master of the laws of power is the Courtier, who possesses more than anything, a talent to influence. Cognizant of how he is perceived at all times in a socially competitive world, the Courtier is ever vigilant to monitor his own effect, ever mindful of the elusiveness of power. I believe that this is what the author means by the Courtiers mirror.  The core realization is that more than anything, human beings are the most social of animals, so it goes without saying that the most socially adapted animal attains the best that life has to offer. Human beings also possess Consciousness to such a heightened degree, that they can deliberately break and follow a path in defiance to their instincts and conditioned or learned behaviors, unlike animals.  In a paradoxical way, learning to play the game of power teaches virtues of mindfulness, patience and mastering ones ego. In this sense, the book permits another legitimate path to the completion of ones life without blindly accepting a given religion.  Well written, argued and referenced, it is abundantly clear how the author reaches his conclusions. It is highly accessible and well digested for the reader. There is a great deal of truth to the idea that a book serves as a mirror for the reader and I am hard pressed to argue against the wisdom contained in this manual. There is great peace of mind to be had from accepting fundamental truths.  Some would read this book and walk away with the impression that this is a ""how to"" on manipulation. Beware of such people, as their delusions make them a danger to themselves and anyone who places trust in them. You need not become a con artist to derive benefit from what is contained here. The laws of cause and effect and the aphorism of ""Know thyself"" are embedded as living proof, ignore them to your peril.",0140280197,"<span>I picked this book up for $1, proof that there is no correlation between cost and value.<br><br>This would be the book that Machievelli would have written, had he courted the Aristocracy of his times, rather than attempting to ingratiate the Prince.<br><br>The author gives a hint to his motivations for this composition when he states in his acknowledgments:<br><br>""Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipulate, torture and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for supplying me with the inspiration for the 48 Laws of Power.""<br><br>This book is cathartic.

R33K16X5ZSI4QZ,Good book. Think of it as a history book that helps get you in a mindset like a sports book might,"I'm bad at explaining things. It seems like people want to try to describe this book as controversial. It's a book.  The Art of War was alright but not great. I read it now and then during tough business times basically to amp myself up some and to actually revise some strategies but it doesn't apply to modern times. You have to make it work.  This book, The 48 Laws of Power, is basically the same but more elaborate obviously. You can read it. You may read things that seem negative. What the author's intentions were I don't care. I read, a lot. I am a moral person but do like different perspectives on things and sometimes just a tiny shift in thinking applied to modern times can solve a modern issue.  4 chapters in, laws, whatever .. would I suggest it? Sure. I mean, I can see where it's going. You'll get nothing out of it if you don't have some intelligence. If you're looking to become some tough guy move on. There's free military manuals on hand to hand combat and such straight from their sites. Free and legal. This book teaches you how to think. You don't read it and try to apply it literally.  So, if your life includes complex situations this may help. For someone that runs multiple businesses, things may seem like battles at times hence books like this. Dealing with other businesses is not like dealing with normal humans. They're inhumane. You won't read this book and take something directly from it but it may spark a thought that leads you to a different or more proper approach to your situation if used properly.  Just .. don't try and do anything you shouldn't. I was a teen once too. As an adult and being way past caring about ""bad things being cool"" and stuff, I do suggest this book to serious people that will read it seriously and try to read it without judgement as you'll likely find something that if not wisdom itself, will be able to be turned into it.",0140280197,"<span>I'm bad at explaining things.

RGOHD4FMHMNVR,A self defense weapon book that is NEEDED!,"The 48 Laws Of Power. Not sure where to really begin, but for people that say it is an ""evil"" book, you are taking it the wrong way. It is a powerful, self defense book NEEDED, because it literally teaches you how to deal with people out there in the world that are negative, toxic, liars, flatterers, fake, angry, suspicious, murderers and many more. To go into in depth detail of the book, here is how it is mainly summed up.  You come across a Law. It says what it is. You then read a Transgression or Observance of the Law. Which these are real, historical stories that you will be reading. Some of these stories are cruel, fascinating, and overall jaw dropping. You'll find some of the worlds most recognized leaders and influencers in these stories.  After you read these stories or the story, the Author gives you an Interpretation. Which is basically the breakdown or meaning of what the law was taking place in the story. After reading the interpretation once, I highly recommend going back to read the story again. This way, you'll gain an even more deeper understanding of the law.  Lastly, the Author leaves you with an image, an authority (which this is a quote by someone) and a reversal. The reversal is basically the conclusion and tells you why you should follow the law.  After you read a law, have a highlighter with you and go back to highlight some of the most important words or quotes. Trust me, A LOT of things will really stick out to you. Really reflect on your own past, personal experiences or situations you've been in with others. You want to do this, because it'll help make you stronger, wiser and more prepared than ever before when you come across any situation or person in the future, because YOU WILL. WE ALL WILL. And I strongly feel that this is why Robert Greene wrote The 48 Laws Of Power. Not just so you can be powerful or controlling over everyone, but mainly how you gain or use power against those who are very dangerous and want to purposely put you down into the ground.  This book is NOT a toy. And don't just think that after you are done with the book, you can immediately just go out and start practicing all the 48 Laws. That is not how it works. It is your responsibility to know what situation you are in and to know what Law will be your bodyguard. Nevertheless, you should always be extremely careful of your own actions and the words that you are going to say. Power should never be underestimated. You must learn to handle it with care. If not handled carefully, its like letting loose a tiger out of its cage and its killing everyone in sight.

RYUD1LUV5KD8B,This book is the red pill,"Perhaps a better tile for this book would be, “The 48 Rules for Mastering Human Psychopathy: Unveiling the Uncomfortable Truth About Human Nature”  This book is a hard pill to swallow. It's a raw and unapologetic exposé of the ruthless game that many of our fellow humans are playing, whether we like to admit it or not. The author lays out the rules for navigating the power plays and manipulations that permeate our society, forcing readers to confront the uncomfortable realities of human behavior.  But amidst the discomfort, there's an opportunity for introspection and empowerment. This book, while unapologetically blunt, serves as a wake-up call, urging readers to open their eyes to the darker aspects of human nature and take control of their own destinies.  While the material may seem ugly and mean-spirited on the surface, it's a stark reflection of the primal instincts and evolutionary forces that shape our interactions. Perhaps, in confronting these harsh truths, we can begin to chart a more altruistic path forward. This book is not for the faint of heart, but for those brave enough to delve into its pages, it offers a chance to navigate the complexities of human relationships with newfound awareness and resilience.  Love it or hate it, it’s a thought-provoking journey into the depths of human behavior—a journey that promises to shake readers out of complacency and spark passionate debate about the true nature of our species.""",0140280197,"<span>Perhaps a better tile for this book would be, “The 48 Rules for Mastering Human Psychopathy: Unveiling the Uncomfortable Truth About Human Nature”<br><br>This book is a hard pill to swallow.

R1NZ1ZGCFAYFZN,What This Comedian Said Will Make You Laugh Hysterically,"In this book Bill Maher skewers both the Cult of Trump and the Church of the Woke. He addresses what he calls Zombie Lies, nonsense that refuses to die no matter how often it is debunked. He addresses the urgency to address climate change and our failure to do so. He makes fun of the sanctimonious hypocrisy in show business, media and society, the racket our universities have turned into, cancel culture, the new attacks on free speech, and he addresses the problems with the Republican party as well as the Democratic party. He brings up a lot of important points that we typically avoid talking about, or can’t even talk honestly about without being shamed, all while adding compelling insights. In the last chapter he has an important message for all of us.  In the past I did not always agree with Bill Maher, especially the period when I was a staunch Republican (centrist now), and I also don’t agree with a lot of aspects of his lifestyle, but I’ve always found him to be funny and smart. I laughed out loud on every page. In fact, I do not recommend that you read this book in public places. People may think you are crazy for sitting somewhere and continuously chuckling to yourself, or mistake you for a Hyena, depending on how your laughter sounds like. I also found that I agreed with almost everything he said. There were a few things I did not agree with him on, but I forgive him for being wrong a few times. He made me laugh more than I have laughed in a long time, while also making me think. This book will anger some people, but before you get too upset about something, read the whole book and try to enjoy the parts that entertain you.

RQXSO0MFYQH8Z,Well said,"Bill Maher's latest book, ""What This Comedian Said Will Shock You,"" is a rollercoaster of a read. It's a collection of his ""editorials"" from his show Real Time, rewritten and updated for today's world. Maher's signature style – sharp, biting, and often hilarious – is on full display here.  If you're a fan of Maher's work, you'll probably find plenty to enjoy in this book. He tackles a wide range of topics, from politics and religion to cancel culture and the media, and his commentary is always thought-provoking, even when you disagree with him. His wit is as sharp as ever, and there are moments of genuine laugh-out-loud humor.  However, the book isn't without its flaws. Maher's tendency to be overly contrarian can be grating at times. He seems to relish in taking the opposite stance, even if it means sacrificing nuance or a deeper understanding of the issue at hand. Some of his jokes can feel a bit dated or simply miss the mark, and his overall tone can be quite cynical.  In terms of structure, the book feels a bit disjointed. The individual chapters are essentially standalone essays, and while they're all connected by Maher's overarching worldview, there's not a clear narrative thread that ties them together. This makes for a choppy reading experience at times.  Overall, ""What This Comedian Said Will Shock You"" is a mixed bag. It's undeniably funny and thought-provoking, and Maher's voice is a unique and valuable one in today's political landscape. However, the book's flaws – its contrarianism, dated jokes, and disjointed structure – prevent it from being truly great. If you're a fan of Maher, you'll probably enjoy it, but if you're not, this book isn't likely to change your mind.",1668051354,"<span>Bill Maher's latest book, ""What This Comedian Said Will Shock You,"" is a rollercoaster of a read.

R27TLZQ9B3VXY8,This man is after my heart and I am not even gay!,"There is hardly a thing in this book that I don’t substantively agree with. His take on the political divide in America is at once incisive, funny, provocative, and dead on balls accurate. The overarching message is national unity, but not in a superficial maudlin way. It’s in a way that respects people who have made America what it is, on both sides of the aisle, and from a time when there wasn’t even an aisle.  Maher has a way of getting deep into why things are the way they are, without sermonizing, and always with a punchline for comic relief.

This book does not hold back any punches when it comes to Trump and the MAGA movement, but at the same time has a word of caution for left leaning people who demonize half of the country at their own peril.

R1J3FYR12J713Q,Great way to bond,"This was so cool. I got one for my Dad, and I got the Mom version for my Mom. Knowing my Mom way better, it was a fun way to get some more details in writing. But for my Dad, it was totally different. Without divulging too much information, my parents divorced over twenty years ago, and my Dad and I have stayed close, and he's always been there for me, but a lot of times in a way that I felt was superficial, having a few meaningful conversations in my adult life, but not many. This book opened the door for him to share much more personal information about his life, his feelings, and his experiences growing up. It made me feel a lot closer to him, and started some new dialogue on similarities I had no idea existed between us. It made who I am make more sense, and cast my Dad in a new light. Don't hesitate to purchase this book, regardless of your relationship with your parent.

R3W50YV6RDQEE9,Read This NOW!,"I seriously don't even know where to begin with this review because all I want to do is fangirl so hard over how much I ADORED this book! Seriously people...every single word, every single scene is so gorgeously written and breathtaking that I had to stop multiple times while I was reading just to admire and appreciate what I just read. This book was absolutely excellent on so many levels that no words can do it justice (but I'm going to try because this is a review after all haha). I don't think it's any secret that Sarah J. Maas is an amazeballs author, but in case you need a reminder, just read this book and you will see the supreme talent this woman has. She could write a phone book and I would read it because somehow even that would be an amazing read. I've only said this about 1 or 2 other authors, but it's completely true.  “There are different kinds of darkness,” Rhys said. I kept my eyes shut. “There is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.” I pictured each. “There is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.”  This book made me feel so many different things at once, and literally it has it ALL! There are amazing twists, snarky banter, beautiful writing, and just plain badass, awesome characters that you want to be best friends with. After finishing this book all I want to do is be in the Night Court and be apart of Rhysand's inner circle. It's probably unhealthy how badly I want this to happen right now. But even more, SJM wrote scenes bursting with heart-pounding action, swoonworthy romance (which be warned, will leaving you squeeing), and female empowerment...GAH! I NEVER wanted to stop reading. But you know what I loved the most? Even though this story is a romance, it is also a story of self-discovery.  “I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again I would not, could not be broken.”  Feyre goes through so much and is incredibly strong. She is extremely relatable because even though she loses herself for a bit, she finds that inner fire that she once had and it causes a spark to ignite within her. She becomes even more amazing than her character was previously, and finds herself on her own. Feyre is such an admirable and relatable character. I mean who among us hasn't felt lost at one point or the other in their life?? Feyre shows everyone that you have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength to rise above and accept the past, and never let that thing that caused you to be lost define you. We need to embrace the pain and the anguish that came with the hand life has dealt, and choose to move forward in life...or we will remain lost. The character development for Feyre was seriously one of the best character development's I have ever read, and I think SJM deserves a HUGE round of applause for giving all readers this character. She becomes stronger and more determined than ever to accomplish what she has set out to do. All the while she remains the stubborn and sassy character we love.  “I was not prey any longer, I decided as I eased up to that door. And I was not a mouse. I was a wolf.”  Rhysand...literally I have no words for my love. My heart (and ovaries) were literally bursting with every word he said. He broke my heart multiple times, and there was one scene in particular where I was gross sobbing when he was revealing things to Feyre. He still remains that mysterious Dark Lord, but we are able to understand and see so much more of him than ever before. Like Feyre, Rhys grew so much in this novel, and I loved watching how he became a little less broken due to Feyre's presence in his life. Feyre provides a nice balance to Rhys, and they're banter is like no other. We all know how shameless a flirt Rhys is, but boy does he step it up in this book...and I loved every single second of it. He had me laughing so hard countless times, and I can't even tell you how much I love him.  The world that SJM has created is simply phenomenal, and I seriously don't know how she came up with her ideas, but let's just thank whoever that she did. There is so much to this world that we didn't know, and I loved learning so many new things over the course of the book. We visit more courts and see different races. We see the political uneasiness that ultimately exists in this world, and how alliances can change at the drop of a hat. And then comes the ending...it is brutal and ripped my heart out, but it left me begging for more! For the entire conclusion I basically had my jaw permanently dropped and then my heart torn out because of the events that SJM wrote. But all I know is that I can't wait to see where she takes this series in the next book because there are truly endless possibilities!  “To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”  If you couldn't tell already, you need to read this book as soon as possible because this is the best book of 2016 so far!

R1Y36G7Q0JSY2K,Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her ...,"A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of my top books of 2015 - possibly even my number one. I have been (not-so-patiently) waiting on A Court of Mist and Fury literally since book one ended and obviously preordered a copy as soon as I could! Upon receiving it in the mail, I quickly started reading but didn't want to read it too quickly. This is one of those books you also want to savor! Especially knowing that I'll have to wait an entire year for the final book in the series. Before I jump into this review, let me say that I do not think Sarah J. Maas can do no wrong. I read the first two books in her Throne of Glass series before giving up on that one. But THIS series... In this series she can do no wrong because every single word of this book was perfection.  This book picks up where the first left off, with Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien back at the Spring Court working on getting the Court back to its former glory. With all that she has been through, Feyre has been left a shell of her former self. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be more worried about keeping up appearances than making sure their Cursebreaker has what she needs to heal and live with her actions. Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her Love, A Court of Mist and Fury is a story about a girl learning to respect herself, finding out who she really is after a huge trauma, with a love story weaved in. Feyre's character growth in this novel was incredible. I said in my review of ACOTAR that she was an unlikable character who I came to really love. Now I can honestly say that Feyre is an amazing, strong female character and the kind of role model I wish teens could read more about (as opposed to the weak female characters who allow a man to define them).  As I'm sure you have probably gathered, in this book Rhysand gives Tamlin a run for his money. As the synopsis says, Rhys has not forgotten the bargain he made with Feyre under the mountain and he plans to make good on it. While I did like Tamlin in the first book, I have made it abundantly clear over the last year that I did not know enough about Rhys to choose a ""team"" and would have to wait until the next book was released to decide. I can now say I am firmly #TeamRhysand at this point and I don't see that changing. Rest assured, there is no love triangle in this book whatsoever, which is a huge relief considering that's what most YA fiction gravitates towards.  I actually loved almost every character in this book, whether I loved them because they were so perfectly wonderful or horrible. The villains are just as terrible as they should be (although Amarantha is going to be damn hard to beat) and the new characters that Feyre aligns herself with grew on me as the story progressed. Surprisingly, I came to like Nesta much more than Elain, which is the exact opposite of how I felt about them in A Court of Thorns and Roses.  One of my favorite things about A Court of Mist and Fury (and honestly, there are so many) was the world building. In book one, we only got to see the Spring Court, Under the Mountain, and the human realm. This time we I got to travel with Feyre all over Prythian and, obviously, my favorite was the Night Court, which was anything but what I expected! Sarah J. Maas' beautiful writing style contributes so much to the love I have for this gorgeous world. I think a lot of other authors would have a really hard time making me care as much as I care about every single location Feyre visits. I'll admit, I usually skim when I get to descriptions of cities and such, but here I took my time to take in every single word on the page.  And then there's the story. Oh, the incredible, beautiful, heart-wrenching story. I loved every single agonizing minute of it. As I've already said, this book is about Feyre discovering who she is after Under the Mountain and she is stronger than anyone realized. There are multiple conflicts for her to deal with - mentally, in her personal relationships, and with a potential war brewing. The journey this book takes over 600+ pages is brutal and extraordinary and heart breaking and I adored it. I was actually a little worried that over 600 pages would be too much, that the story would get bogged down or that it would lag, but it didn't. There wasn't non-stop action, but everything that happened was relevant and I couldn't name anything that served only as filler.  Something to definitely keep in mind is that this book has significantly more sexual content than the first, but I'm totally okay with that. As a 28 year old lover of YA, I was thrilled for the authenticity this little bit of extra explicitness brought to this story. I mean, when characters are talking about marriage and are fighting wars, it's not out of the question that they're probably going to be having more adult relationships. But I do think it's important to point out for those readers who perhaps don't want to read steamier scenes. (I'm sure you could easily skip past them.)  As you can probably tell, I loved this book. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it, which is unusual for me, even when I rate a book five stars. I loved Feyre, I loved Rhysand, and I loved their constant bantering back and forth. I loved that Feyre learned to respect herself. I loved the gorgeous writing and world building and storytelling. I honestly cannot go on without becoming a total fangirl so instead I'll leave you with what I have dubbed Rhysand's theme song (you're welcome): [...]",1635575583,"<span>A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of my top books of 2015 - possibly even my number one.

In this series she can do no wrong because every single word of this book was perfection.<br><br>This book picks up where the first left off, with Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien back at the Spring Court working on getting the Court back to its former glory. With all that she has been through, Feyre has been left a shell of her former self. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be more worried about keeping up appearances than making sure their Cursebreaker has what she needs to heal and live with her actions. Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her Love, A Court of Mist and Fury is a story about a girl learning to respect herself, finding out who she really is after a huge trauma, with a love story weaved in. Feyre's character growth in this novel was incredible. I said in my review of ACOTAR that she was an unlikable character who I came to really love. Now I can honestly say that Feyre is an amazing, strong female character and the kind of role model I wish teens could read more about (as opposed to the weak female characters who allow a man to define them).<br><br>As I'm sure you have probably gathered, in this book Rhysand gives Tamlin a run for his money. As the synopsis says, Rhys has not forgotten the bargain he made with Feyre under the mountain and he plans to make good on it. While I did like Tamlin in the first book, I have made it abundantly clear over the last year that I did not know enough about Rhys to choose a ""team"" and would have to wait until the next book was released to decide. I can now say I am firmly #TeamRhysand at this point and I don't see that changing. Rest assured, there is no love triangle in this book whatsoever, which is a huge relief considering that's what most YA fiction gravitates towards.<br><br>I actually loved almost every character in this book, whether I loved them because they were so perfectly wonderful or horrible. The villains are just as terrible as they should be (although Amarantha is going to be damn hard to beat) and the new characters that Feyre aligns herself with grew on me as the story progressed. Surprisingly, I came to like Nesta much more than Elain, which is the exact opposite of how I felt about them in A Court of Thorns and Roses.<br><br>One of my favorite things about A Court of Mist and Fury (and honestly, there are so many) was the world building. In book one, we only got to see the Spring Court, Under the Mountain, and the human realm. This time we I got to travel with Feyre all over Prythian and, obviously, my favorite was the Night Court, which was anything but what I expected! Sarah J. Maas' beautiful writing style contributes so much to the love I have for this gorgeous world. I think a lot of other authors would have a really hard time making me care as much as I care about every single location Feyre visits. I'll admit, I usually skim when I get to descriptions of cities and such, but here I took my time to take in every single word on the page.<br><br>And then there's the story. Oh, the incredible, beautiful, heart-wrenching story. I loved every single agonizing minute of it. As I've already said, this book is about Feyre discovering who she is after Under the Mountain and she is stronger than anyone realized. There are multiple conflicts for her to deal with - mentally, in her personal relationships, and with a potential war brewing. The journey this book takes over 600+ pages is brutal and extraordinary and heart breaking and I adored it. I was actually a little worried that over 600 pages would be too much, that the story would get bogged down or that it would lag, but it didn't. There wasn't non-stop action, but everything that happened was relevant and I couldn't name anything that served only as filler.<br><br>Something to definitely keep in mind is that this book has significantly more sexual content than the first, but I'm totally okay with that. As a 28 year old lover of YA, I was thrilled for the authenticity this little bit of extra explicitness brought to this story. I mean, when characters are talking about marriage and are fighting wars, it's not out of the question that they're probably going to be having more adult relationships. But I do think it's important to point out for those readers who perhaps don't want to read steamier scenes. (I'm sure you could easily skip past them.)<br><br>As you can probably tell, I loved this book. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it, which is unusual for me, even when I rate a book five stars. I loved Feyre, I loved Rhysand, and I loved their constant bantering back and forth. I loved that Feyre learned to respect herself. I loved the gorgeous writing and world building and storytelling. I honestly cannot go on without becoming a total fangirl so instead I'll leave you with what I have dubbed Rhysand's theme song (you're welcome): [...]</span>",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1Y36G7Q0JSY2K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1635575583,5,False,True,29.0,us,False,3,1,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2016",2016-05-16T00:00:00.000Z,Tracy @ Cornerfolds,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFGE44VBNCZMEWMM4R3PZZX2V3JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AFGE44VBNCZMEWMM4R3PZZX2V3JA,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/88dd70c4-9539-41e0-909e-9e9dc431190f._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",,,,

R34Y0ZHWGUN48L,"The ending was stunning, as always, but I had character issues.","** Warning: This is NOT a spoiler-free review like I usually write. I won’t give away twists from the very end but I WILL be discussing things that happened throughout the beginning and middle of the book! **  I was pleasantly surprised when I read A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES last year because going into it, I knew it was a story with a strong fae presence. By this point in time in my reading career, I wasn’t new to fantasy but I was still a bit picky about what sort of fantasy I liked and fae did not fall into that category of selected themes… But knowing how much I loved Sarah’s Throne of Glass series and the fae presence there, I dove into ACOTAR and loved it! It had a bit of a BREAKING DAWN ending so I wasn’t quite sure where the second book would go but naturally I had very, very high hopes for it since I hadn’t been let down by a Maas book yet!  I won’t sugar coat it — it actually took me a really long time to get into the swing of this book. I was enjoying the plot but the beginning felt so incredibly dramatic and I just didn’t feel like things were moving forward. There was a lot of time spent on Feyre’s PTSD from her time Under the Mountain and I absolutely understand and don’t think that her traumatic experience should be just brushed over. I do felt like there was too much time dwelling on it though. ACOMAF isn’t a short book and I think some pages could have been saved and still gotten the point across throughout a few sections in the beginning. If the book were more character-based instead of plot-driven, it might have been more appropriate but the plot really seemed to suffer because of this and this isn’t the first time I felt this way in a Maas book either. I understand that these characters have gone through something that truly does change them but I felt like I was reading about totally different characters when I started ACOMAF. Feyre and Tamlin were just not themselves and I think had ACOTAR ended with a bit more of this shadow or if it had slowly creeped in throughout ACOMAF, it wouldn’t have been as much of a surprise. I just really felt like I was thrown into a totally new environment and it was really hard for me to adjust to, especially since I had read ACOTAR over a year before I got to start ACOMAF.  I continued to have issues with Feyre throughout the book. I don’t know why but she was just really bothering me. Instead of snarky, witty comebacks, I felt like everything with her was taken as an insult and she was constantly being defensive and kind of hated everyone. It was really hard to watch her interact with characters and I started to latch onto new (or new-to-the-spotlight) characters like Rhysand and his gang. It did make me extra thankful for Rhys coming onto the scene and shaking things up, though! The interactions between Feyre and Tamlin were just unbearable and painful to read. Then I ended up on the flip side where although I didn’t want Feyre and Tamlin to still be together, I also felt really weird that Tamlin was almost totally absent from this book. He was there in the beginning and I won’t speak of the ending but this book was straight up about Feyre and Rhysand and it almost felt like a waste that we spent all that time building up a romance between Feyre and Tamlin in ACOTAR to have it totally change. I absolutely love where it went but it’s confusing to understand why the Feyre/Tamlin romance was so important and developed in ACOTAR and why Rhysand wasn’t more of a main character throughout that courtship to really get his foot even more in the door.  I’ve followed the romances in Sarah J. Maas’ books quite well, I think, considering they’re not always simple and straightforward. I know some people who have issues with love triangles or already have their OTPs with the first love interest really have trouble moving with the characters as they fall out of love or move from one interest to realize that their true match is someone else and I feel like I’ve followed along with that fairly easily. I can see where people feel like the romance in ACOMAF is a love triangle and I guess to a certain extent it is, but Feyre also does not have interest in both men at the same time. It is quite complicated though so if you’re sensitive about triangles, you almost definitely won’t like the romance.  I personally loved the development of Rhysand as a love interest, especially once Feyre really started to struggle with Tamlin. I found it telling that at the hardest points in their lives, Feyre and Tamlin drifted apart and just couldn’t find a way to even communicate instead of being able to rely on one another and get through a hard time together. That doesn’t always mean that you shouldn’t be with someone but in the case of story telling, it’s a pretty big sign that the main character isn’t where they should be. I’ve heard this complaint from other Maas readers but this is the first of her books where I really felt like the romance started to take over the book. While I did love the new Rhysand/Feyre development, I felt like there was a lot of back and forth between them before anything major (finally) happened and that could have been cut down to some more meaningful interactions instead of repetitive, similar situations that happened more than a few times throughout the course of the story. Their romance actually is a very important part of the plot so it’s not like I wanted it to be downplayed but I just felt like so many points of the large general story were pushed aside to develop the romantic moments and it started to turn more romance story than epic fantasy — and yes, there are some cheesy romance book-worthy moments. Let’s just say this is NOT A YOUNG ADULT BOOK, friends. There are some very explicit scenes so if you have teens or are directing/teaching teens who are reading this series, you may not want to put this book directly into their hands. (Not that I’m saying censor them but. Ya know. Read it first so you know what you’re giving them.)  The sections where the plot progressed were really quite delightful. Sarah J. Maas is still a master at layering stories and it’s so interesting to see how much of a previous book comes back in a different light in a subsequent book. There were so many moments that the reader is able to recognize from ACOMAF and see from a different character’s perspective or reassess it with more information and it makes the story that much deeper! Once things started to really take off around halfway through and a little thereafter, the book was simply addicting and I couldn’t wait to see where the entire plot of the series was going! Sarah really does have an amazing ability to craft an overall series arc and it’s so fun to watch that develop. The ending positively floored me and it was hard to remember why I had been so frustrated for a while throughout earlier sections of the book. So many things were revealed, actions taken, and trusts betrayed that I just really didn’t know what was coming. The twists and surprises were epic and once again, I was left in utter anticipation of the next book!",1635575583,"<span>** Warning: This is NOT a spoiler-free review like I usually write.

RV7OL5JY4M1WG,Rhysand + You = Hurry up and read this book!,"This book was everything I had hoped it would, and SO MUCH more! I loved it as much as I love Rhysland. There, I said it. There's romance, sensuality, character growth, action, betrayal, friendships, family ties, and so much more. The character developments, the story telling, the world building, and the way Maas wrote this story is AWESOME! This book is the packaged deal. Okay, I'll admit it, Rhysand is the packaged deal in this book.  I knew there was much more to Rhysand than we got to know in A Court of Thorns and Roses. Boy is there a lot more to him! I loved the way I got to know him in this book. Maas held things back from readers, allowing us to get to know Rhysand as Feyre got to know him. Part of that is what made it easier to fall in love with his character. The more I got to know him, the easier it was for me to really see him for who he was, and in turn made it easy to see the differences between him and Tamlin. Rhysland is that character you want on your side. He's loyal to those close to him, doesn't apologize for who he really is, doesn't hold back when it comes to loving a certain someone, and unlike some characters, he sees Feyre for all that she really is, and allows her to be who she is, and all that she's becoming.  Despite the fact he can make anyone do anything he wants, Rhysland gives Feyre choices, and allows her to make them. He wants her to be who she wants to be. Rhysand a character that readers will get to see all sides of, and fall in love with in the process. I love the way he treats Feyre, and his court. He's very powerful, someone to fear, yet for all the darkness that resides within him, I came to understand how the darkness he has calms and brings peace to Feyre. He is that person who isn't only compassionate and loyal when it comes to his court, he's someone who knows how to treat to a woman. He treats Feyre with so much love, respect and understanding. *sigh* Just wait until you see how he treats her... you won't be able to resist falling for him either. I've completely fallen in love with his character.  Feyre by all means is an equal to Rhys. Not only did I love their banter, electric chemistry, and those hot scenes between them ( I swear the pages ignited in this book more than a few times), I loved how she fell for Rhysand. The more I got to know him, the more I understood how she slowly started to fall for him. It was natural and made sense. Most importantly, I loved that she realized she is worth so much more than she's ever thought. I loved that she grew into a strong, fierce character/women who not only learned to love herself, but love someone who truly loved her, and didn't want to keep her in a cage. I loved that she learned to fight, and embrace her powers, both literally and figuratively. She grew so much, and I loved that she became a force to reckon with. What I admired the most about Feyre's character development in this book, is that she learned to love herself. She learned to embrace who she is, and all that she is. I respected her even more for that.  The romance and character chemistry in this book was on fire! The banter, and flirting between Rhysand and Feyre was, well that's just say these two know how to push each other's buttons, and get under each other's skin in all the right ways. Together, Feyre and Rhysland are something amazing. Aside from all the physical aspects, and passion these two share, I love that they chase away the darkness that threatens to consume the other. They both have experienced horrific things that they are still dealing with. They are each other's hope, and light. They're there for each other and help pull each other out of the darkness, or sometimes are there to hold the other as they endure the nightmares.  One of the things I liked about theme of love in this book, is the way Feyre came to realize what it truly meant to be loved and be in love, vs what she thought love was. I appreciated the fact that Maas doesn't just tell her readers this, she shows us through character actions. We see it through Feyre's realization of what Rhysand's been telling her, and how he treats her vs how Tamlin treats her. Tamlin's fall from grace is that he didn't respect Feyre enough to allow her to be herself. He didn't treat her like an equal, but instead wanted keep her locked up and in his possession. I may have got the 'why' in that, but I didn't agree with it at all. The contrast between how Rhysand and Tamlin both treated Feyre was painfully obvious through out the book.  Maas has a way with creating in-depth characters I really come to care about. She effortlessly brings them to life, as well as their stories, and vividly detailed worlds. I loved getting to go deeper into the Fey world, being introduced to more characters, and seeing the different parts of their world. I loved getting to know the Night Court. Maas has always created characters that really add depth to the story, and the Night Court was no different. I loved meeting and getting to know Rhys's inner circle. These characters weren't only friends, they are family, and it really showed in their story. Along with the Night Court, which has become my favorite court, I loved seeing more of the other characters, and learning about their histories, and ties together with their courts.  I felt every range of emotion possible while reading this book. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I swooned, got swept off my feet, was happy, angry (at a certain someone), and I completely fell in love with all that this book offered me. I officially have a book hang over. Sarah J. Maas what have you done to me?! The turn of events, the character developments, and the over all story are that good! I feel bad for the next book I read after this one, because I already had to re-read this book once, because it was so good. I don't even know what else I can say, other than, that is one heck of an awesome sequel! Now the torture will be waiting a whole another for the next book!  *There are sensual scenes, and well written sex scenes through out the book, as well as the use of the f-word a few times through out the book, making it a book that may not be suitable for younger YA readers.",1635575583,"<span>This book was everything I had hoped it would, and SO MUCH more! I loved it as much as I love Rhysland. There, I said it. There's romance, sensuality, character growth, action, betrayal, friendships, family ties, and so much more. The character developments, the story telling, the world building, and the way Maas wrote this story is AWESOME! This book is the packaged deal. Okay, I'll admit it, Rhysand is the packaged deal in this book.<br><br>I knew there was much more to Rhysand than we got to know in A Court of Thorns and Roses. Boy is there a lot more to him! I loved the way I got to know him in this book. Maas held things back from readers, allowing us to get to know Rhysand as Feyre got to know him. Part of that is what made it easier to fall in love with his character. The more I got to know him, the easier it was for me to really see him for who he was, and in turn made it easy to see the differences between him and Tamlin. Rhysland is that character you want on your side. He's loyal to those close to him, doesn't apologize for who he really is, doesn't hold back when it comes to loving a certain someone, and unlike some characters, he sees Feyre for all that she really is, and allows her to be who she is, and all that she's becoming.<br><br>Despite the fact he can make anyone do anything he wants, Rhysland gives Feyre choices, and allows her to make them. He wants her to be who she wants to be. Rhysand a character that readers will get to see all sides of, and fall in love with in the process. I love the way he treats Feyre, and his court. He's very powerful, someone to fear, yet for all the darkness that resides within him, I came to understand how the darkness he has calms and brings peace to Feyre. He is that person who isn't only compassionate and loyal when it comes to his court, he's someone who knows how to treat to a woman. He treats Feyre with so much love, respect and understanding. *sigh* Just wait until you see how he treats her... you won't be able to resist falling for him either. I've completely fallen in love with his character.<br><br>Feyre by all means is an equal to Rhys. Not only did I love their banter, electric chemistry, and those hot scenes between them ( I swear the pages ignited in this book more than a few times), I loved how she fell for Rhysand. The more I got to know him, the more I understood how she slowly started to fall for him. It was natural and made sense. Most importantly, I loved that she realized she is worth so much more than she's ever thought. I loved that she grew into a strong, fierce character/women who not only learned to love herself, but love someone who truly loved her, and didn't want to keep her in a cage. I loved that she learned to fight, and embrace her powers, both literally and figuratively. She grew so much, and I loved that she became a force to reckon with. What I admired the most about Feyre's character development in this book, is that she learned to love herself. She learned to embrace who she is, and all that she is. I respected her even more for that.<br><br>The romance and character chemistry in this book was on fire! The banter, and flirting between Rhysand and Feyre was, well that's just say these two know how to push each other's buttons, and get under each other's skin in all the right ways. Together, Feyre and Rhysland are something amazing. Aside from all the physical aspects, and passion these two share, I love that they chase away the darkness that threatens to consume the other. They both have experienced horrific things that they are still dealing with. They are each other's hope, and light. They're there for each other and help pull each other out of the darkness, or sometimes are there to hold the other as they endure the nightmares.<br><br>One of the things I liked about theme of love in this book, is the way Feyre came to realize what it truly meant to be loved and be in love, vs what she thought love was. I appreciated the fact that Maas doesn't just tell her readers this, she shows us through character actions. We see it through Feyre's realization of what Rhysand's been telling her, and how he treats her vs how Tamlin treats her. Tamlin's fall from grace is that he didn't respect Feyre enough to allow her to be herself. He didn't treat her like an equal, but instead wanted keep her locked up and in his possession. I may have got the 'why' in that, but I didn't agree with it at all. The contrast between how Rhysand and Tamlin both treated Feyre was painfully obvious through out the book.<br><br>Maas has a way with creating in-depth characters I really come to care about.

R28D4JAU3EW0LN,Fifty Shades of Feyre and Rhys,"A Court of Mist and Fury is the sequel to A Court of Thorns and Roses. I don't even know how to function as I write this review. Sarah J Maas has literally just written her best book yet. And that's saying something because her Throne of Glass series books are phenomenal.  Feyre has completely transformed in this book. We last seen her made into a Fae, after Amarantha had killed her Under the Mountain in book one. All 7 High Lords from each court used a spark of their power to revive Feyre, and make her into a Fae. What they didn't know was that they would make her into something beyond their power. When they gave her their spark, they also gave her powers from each court. Throughout the book we see her train and practice her new found powers, and she definitely comes into her own.  Her relationship with Tamlin becomes very strenuous because like Feyre, he was broken in more ways than one Under the Mountain. We see him become a very dark and tortured soul, holding Feyre as a captive. He does not include her in the going-ons of the court, and he insists on locking her up and having her guarded at all costs. Most would see this as an act of love, someone who literal saw the person he loves die, while he was forced to watch idly. However, Feyre feels stifled. And while she's broken too, she can't forgive him for not fighting against Amarantha as she destroyed her. And who can blame her. When Rhys, High Lord of the Night Court even tried fighting to save her, and at the time he was perceived as the enemy in Feyre's eyes.  Rhysand--- I don't even know where to begin. Never in a million years would I have guessed that a love to rival all loves would blossom between Feyre and Rhys. Due to their bargain, Feyre was forced to go to the Night Court once a month. Whisked away by the fiercely dark and handsome Rhys, Tamlin was forced to see his Fiancé taken by his enemy. At first, Feyre hates him, until she truly sees the driving force behind Rhys' actions. He is dark and powerful, but he is loyal to those he loves, and would do anything to protect them, which winds up including Feyre. I won't give too much away, but the love that builds between them was so intriguing to read. Sarah J Maas made a very interesting choice to write this book with an older audience in mind. There were lots of intense sex scenes with not so quite kid-friendly language.  At first, this threw me off because I know this is a Young Adult book. I didn't see how well it would mesh together. But as the book progressed, Sarah's risk totally blossomed into something magnificent. Feyre's and Rhys' relationship was primal, animalistic, and intense. It showed us what we become when we let our base desires completely take over. It was a thrill-seeking ride, that often left me feeling hot and bothered---if you know what I mean.  Besides the development of these two characters, we also got to meet some new characters, those from the Night Court. Mor, the beautiful and powerful third in command, and also Rhys' cousin. She instantly befriended Feyre, and they had plenty of much needed girl-bonding time. Cassian, one of two of Illyrian's top fighters. An enigmatic, hot-tempered, yet playful character that is protective of both Mor and Azriel. Azriel, the one of a kind Shadowsinger. He encases himself in shadows, and the shadows speak to him. Rhys uses him as his spymaster, because he's a master at stealth and getting information out of people.He's also the other Illyrian that's the strongest fighter, along with Cassian. Also, he's completely in love with Mor. Lastly, my personal favorite, Amren. She's said to be an ancient creature. A creature that slipped into this universe when the world was created. While it's said that there might be others like her, she's also one of a kind. Her power is ancient , and Rhys said that its contained within the body she's using. However he lets us know that if she was ever released, the world would be in huge trouble. Amren is also Rhys' second in command.  The world building was absolutely mind-blowing in this book. Maas' descriptions of the city of Velaris, the city that Rhys has protected from the outside world, was so utterly beautiful. The landscape was breath taking, and the fact that it hasn't been influenced by outside forces and was able to prosper in peace was so beautiful to read about. It was like a hidden Utopia. Rhys has taken the brunt of negative opinions towards his court and him, in order to keep Velaris safe and untainted. He would rather be viewed as a sadistic killer, who's shrouded in darkness and can turn your mind to mush, rather than let his hidden gem Velaris be tarnished.  The plot was easy to follow and allowed us readers to see some of the history of the world within the book. The King of Hybern is the main villain in this book. He is using a Cauldron, the object that is believed to be what created all life, and holds unimaginable power, so he can wage a war on any who oppose him. He also wants to bring down the ancient wall that prevents the Fae from entering the land where humans reside.  Only one object can counter and nullify the Cauldron, and it is the book of Breathings. However, it was torn in two and carded off to two places. One is in the Summer Court, and the other is in the land where the human's are, protected by the Mortal Queens. This happened as a peace treaty back in the last war that Mor was very much apart of. She helped create the treaty between the mortal queens of that time and the Fae. Amren as ancient as she is, knows of the book and is the only person that can read it's language. And ironically, Feyre is the only one who can actually use it because she was once a mortal, and now is a Fae.  Overall, Sarah J Maas has written her best book yet. A Court of Mist and Fury is deeply primitive in its showing of our base desires. Love, sex, and bonding are taken to new heights in Feyre's and Rhys' relationship, and readers will often find themselves completely turned on. Readers will also lose their breath as they dive into Maas' many beautiful descriptions of her world. And will become engrossed in the history of the world she's created, and watch transfixed, as each character navigates within it and progresses the plot until it's nail-biting climax. The ending will have you pulling out your hair.  If you haven't read A Court of Thorns and Roses book one of the series, please go out and do so.

R1FTCHSSQ7EZ15,“To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”,"“Hello, Feyre darling,” he purred.  I forgot how utterly in love with A Court of Mist and Fury I am. A stunning story paired with the loveliest slow burn and a charming enemies to friends to lovers progression.  “You are my salvation, Feyre.”  Rhysand. He is, just, everything. Honestly a top tier book boyfriend. An alluring bad-boy paired with typical arrogance and a clever mind. His outward elegance and beauty are obvious but his internal beauty is what truly makes Rhys stand out. His selflessness towards his court and Feyre, the carefully crafted mask he shows everyone else, and the intensity that he cares and loves. Rhysand isn't perfect, not even close, but he really stole the show in this story.  “You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written?” Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I’d seen it. “I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince—the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”  Feyre spends most of her time in the Night Court, embarking on missions and adjusting to her new immortal life. I was so proud of Feyre and getting herself out the other end. This book is heavy on dealing with the aftermath of trauma from the events under the mountain and my heart really ached for her during the first half of this book. She grew an incredible amount and it was like coming back up for air watching Feyre, with the help of those who truly care for her, become stronger, more determined, and a dreamer.  “When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.”  There were so many scenes between these two that will live forever permanently in my mind. ✰ Feyre throwing her shoe at Rhys the first time he brought her to the Night Court 👠 ✰ Their snow fight in the human realm ❄️ ✰ The Court of Nightmares throne scene 🔥 ✰ Their sparring match where he cocooned her with his wings 🦇 ✰ Their flirty note exchanges 🖊️ ✰ THE PAINT SCENE 🎨  “I’m thinking it would be very easy to love you. And easier to call you my friend.”  We were introduced to many new faces in aCoMaF and the most enjoyable were the Inner Circle with a special shout out to the High Lord from the Summer Court. But honestly, the IC are actual squad/family goals. Morrigan, Mor, is as loyal as she is fierce. Amren, I don't know who you really are but your arrogance and sass call to my heart. Cassian, the jokester who can bring a smile to anyone's face. Last but never least, Azriel, you mysterious and slightly stalker ways are like an invisible string to my deepest desires. I cannot express how critical it is in a fantasy series to have complex and dimensional secondary characters that you feel drawn to.  “For him, I had done this-for him I'd gladly wrecked myself and my immortal soul. And now I had an eternity to live with it.”  Finally, I want to discuss the big bad wolf in the room...Tamlin. I understand why he is so hated but I don't hate Tamlin. To be candid, even in the my first read through of this series, I was never really drawn to Tamlin or sold on his and Feyre being endgame. Something just felt off. This book really explored and demonstrated why they aren't good together. But that doesn't mean Tamlin is the villain he is portrayed through the lenses of Feyre and Rhysand. Tamlin also left that mountain with trauma and fear . It is this fear that drove most of Tamlin's action, in particular how he treated Feyre. His fear led him to overcompensate in how he protected Feyre, his need for control after having none, and his ignorance in the trauma that both he and Feyre were drowning in. None of this excuses his behavior but it helps us understand his actions. I think Tamlin has some really hard lessons to learn but if I know SJM, I like to pretend I do , I think Tamlin isn't too far gone that he can't redeem himself.  “That I will bow before no one and nothing but my crown.”  I am going to wrap this up and just say that after reading this series more than a few times, each time feels like a new addition to the experience and I find myself like one of those tiktok's of the bookish girls trying to dive into the physical book because I would love for nothing more than to actually be part of this world.",1635575583,"<span>“Hello, Feyre darling,” he purred.<br><br>I forgot how utterly in love with A Court of Mist and Fury I am.

I cannot express how critical it is in a fantasy series to have complex and dimensional secondary characters that you feel drawn to.<br><br>“For him, I had done this-for him I'd gladly wrecked myself and my immortal soul. And now I had an eternity to live with it.”<br><br>Finally, I want to discuss the big bad wolf in the room...Tamlin. I understand why he is so hated but I don't hate Tamlin. To be candid, even in the my first read through of this series, I was never really drawn to Tamlin or sold on his and Feyre being endgame. Something just felt off. This book really explored and demonstrated why they aren't good together. But that doesn't mean Tamlin is the villain he is portrayed through the lenses of Feyre and Rhysand. Tamlin also left that mountain with trauma and fear . It is this fear that drove most of Tamlin's action, in particular how he treated Feyre. His fear led him to overcompensate in how he protected Feyre, his need for control after having none, and his ignorance in the trauma that both he and Feyre were drowning in. None of this excuses his behavior but it helps us understand his actions. I think Tamlin has some really hard lessons to learn but if I know SJM, I like to pretend I do , I think Tamlin isn't too far gone that he can't redeem himself.<br><br>“That I will bow before no one and nothing but my crown.”<br><br>I am going to wrap this up and just say that after reading this series more than a few times, each time feels like a new addition to the experience and I find myself like one of those tiktok's of the bookish girls trying to dive into the physical book because I would love for nothing more than to actually be part of this world.</span>",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FTCHSSQ7EZ15/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1635575583,5,False,True,3.0,us,False,9,1,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024",2024-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,Christina Marsh,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGRZ7AQXC4XMJJLXA5GK6G3HPVTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AGRZ7AQXC4XMJJLXA5GK6G3HPVTA,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/943ac757-d5eb-4c7d-b07c-02d18f373325._CR0,26.0,281,281_SX48_.jpg",,,,
R1AF9TSJA56WSO,Definitely 4 Stars,"If you liked A Court of Thorns and Roses, then you're going to like this book too. For me, this book is WAY better. (The first was very slow for me. See my review of a Court of Thorns and Roses.)  To me, this is where the overall story started to get good. This book moved a lot faster, and I found it much more interesting. That probably had to do with the fact that you're continuing a character's story, and more characters were introduced. (Though, my favorite side character remains to be Lucien.)  This book expands the world of Prynthian for the reader and there's a lot more action.  I haven't finished this book yet, I'm about 90% done and certain questions I have from when I first started still haven't been answered. This is what will probably make me pick up book 3 and doesn't that make the author very clever?  I give this book a solid 4 stars. For the pacing and overall storyline. For the fact that it made me like Feyre a LITTLE more than I did in the beginning. (I still can't bring myself to really like her.) For the fact of confirming why I was Team Rhys from the very start. Tamlin seems like a good guy, but Rhys stole the show from the first time he was introduced in my opinion.  The Spring Court was beautiful, but the Night Court had DEPTH.  I will be continuing with book 3.  Update: I actually finished the book the same day I wrote the above review. I saw a lot of other readers' reviews with the title: WOW and I echo the sentiments. The moment I was done with this book I immediately dove into book 3. And by the end of this book my opinion of Feyre has changed. I won't say that I love her now, but I definitely like her.  Even if you had a hard time reading book one like I did, reading this book makes up for all the struggle you went through. Book 3 seems to be shaping up to be if not as good, better.

R27Z2LGNI7BO4P,The BEST book in the series! Definitely a must read (No spoilers),"My friend recommended the ACOTAR series to me because I love a good guilty pleasure romance novel (with a touch of smut). The first book was good, but just didn't scratch the itch. But A Court of Mist and Fury was the real MVP. This book was absolutely amazing in every way and it tied together with the first book beautifully.  So I won't spoil anything, but the romance in this book is just perfection. I love a good will they won't they, and this built up the suspense for a firework climax (no pun intended). I mean, I read this book over a year ago and I still think about it.  It's not just the relationship that makes this book good though. It is well written with a lot of action and drama that keeps you interested cover to cover. I found myself unable to put this book down. If you liked the vividly descriptive action in the first book, this one will not disappoint.  This is high up on the list of my favorite books. Whenever I hear that someone is starting the ACOTAR series, I tell them that this 2nd book is the reason for reading it. I cannot stress that enough. The other books are fine, but this one is the masterpiece of the series.  Please read it! If you were underwhelmed by the first book, I PROMISE this one will make it all worth it.

R2J7AR708NQXQ8,Wow,"I said in my review for the first book that it seemed unoriginal and the romance was a bit hollow. And that’s still true. And I don’t know if this author realized the weakness in her first book and built off of that, or if it was all intentional, but— holy subversion Batman— this second book was amazing.  Where the romance in the first book was hollow, the romance in this one was full. I love a vulnerable hero. The balance of vulnerable and powerful in this hero was just magic, and some of those beautiful love scenes will live rent-free in my brain for a while.  I also just admire how she managed to turn a happily-ever-after into a never-mind in so few pages, and launch off from there. It all felt so believable, and I never for one moment questioned the heroine’s choices. Talk about a strong female character.  The whole book from that point on was harrowing and intense and full of love and life, to the point where I actually may need to take a break and read something light and fluffy before moving on to book 3.

ROYKMXCE721O6,"I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again.","*Review originally posted on Goodreads*  ❝I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again. I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.❞  A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn't hyped up like there's no tomorrow. It was the first book I've read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.  I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven't picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it's been released. That's just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn't say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.  I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?  Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas's books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn't worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn't written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn't some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.  But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn't going to happen. These two people that survived weren't the same people that were Under the Mountain. They're relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.  In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre's own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don't acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn't protect her the way he wanted and he didn't fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she's being suffocated. It still doesn't excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he's just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He's just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.  As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he's kept, and the sacrifices he's made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I'm not completely sure if I'm 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would've been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn't get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I'm slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.  With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.  Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can't handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.  Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J.

I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again. I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.❞<br><br>A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn't hyped up like there's no tomorrow. It was the first book I've read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.<br><br>I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven't picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it's been released. That's just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn't say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.<br><br>I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?<br><br>Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas's books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn't worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn't written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn't some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.<br><br>But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn't going to happen. These two people that survived weren't the same people that were Under the Mountain. They're relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.<br><br>In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre's own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don't acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn't protect her the way he wanted and he didn't fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she's being suffocated. It still doesn't excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he's just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He's just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.<br><br>As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he's kept, and the sacrifices he's made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I'm not completely sure if I'm 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would've been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn't get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I'm slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.<br><br>With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.<br><br>Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can't handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.<br><br>Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy.</span>",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROYKMXCE721O6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1635575583,5,False,True,24.0,us,False,7,2,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2016",2016-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,Mikee Andrea Quiambao,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF7ZO6ZTSDZMEDHBDD4XEXZ3PKPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AF7ZO6ZTSDZMEDHBDD4XEXZ3PKPQ,,,,,

Thoughts: I don’t like Feyre. That was my mindset when I started the book. Feyre was nothing but selfish in “A Court of Thorns and Rose” and oh, did she make my blood boil. And even in this book, I was like that as well…but that’s an explanation for later. Because I truly enjoyed this story! So much that I have a picture of Velaris as my wallpaper on my phone.  I didn’t want to give Tiktok the credit. I DEFINITELY didn’t want to jump on the bandwagon of this series. But why am I on Etsy about to buy a shirt that says “Wingspan Matters”? Why are there Velaris stickers in my cart? And why is Rhysand so damn irresistible???  I’m doomed. I’m drinking the kool-aid and I don’t even remember it coming into my hand. Oh…god.  In this second book of the series, we continue to follow Feyre after she saves Prythian from that crazy red headed demon woman with blue balls for Tamlin (lol) and she gets to head home with her flower beast man, but realizes that life as the soon-to-be wife of the High Lord of Spring Court is not what she thought it would be. Everyday was boring, soul shattering, depressing, and a prison. But the only freedom she has is that one week of the month with Rhysand at the Night Court. The story progresses as Feyre finds her strength in herself and others, learns not to judge a book by its cover, and that family (even if it’s found) and love (when is deep and true) is worth dying for.  You see there? I spoke highly of the girl! Because GOD DAMN was she killing me all ACOTAR and up to Chapter 34 in ACOMAF. Feyre’s absolute selfishness and denial is so insufferable that I had to put the book down, walk away, and scream into a pillow. She is a walking billboard for “pity parties” and “misery loves company”. She is manipulative and honestly a liability. She only cares about herself and what others can do to benefit her. She doesn’t want to understand people but wants people to understand her. Pot meet Kettle.  I don’t like Feyre. I AM VERY ANTI FEYRE.  But holy smoke, am I loving her journey! The world building and character development is absolutely amazing. Maas knows how to write a book! I literally am transported to this world when I read like I’m watching a movie on a big screen. I have fallen in love with the characters (even Nesta!). I am envious of the beauty and danger of this world. I am absolutely desperate to pick up the next book in the series and keep going and going and going. This series is fantastic so far. Fantastic!  When it comes to favorite characters, I will have to say Rhysand the one. How well written is this man that you feel his pain and pure desperation to save his found family and city. To stand up for the people around him and build a home and community he’s proud of. Plus he is sexy as hell! Take ME far away so I can hear that roar. But that pain in MY hair! Also, Amren…oooooo y’all look out for her! Badass incarnate and I can not WAIT to see what she is and where she came from.  Also another favorite for me in this books is the Summer Court scenes. Tarquin, though not a massive part in this book, is a man you can easily fall in love with. Dark skin and white hair amongst a beautiful never ending summer lane. Loved it! I could literally smell the salt air and hear the gulls. The beauty described filled my mind and the chaos of the situation/mission made my heart pound with excitement and awe.  So yea, I may be a Feyre hater…but it has not stopped me from seeing the vision Maas is showing in the ACOTAR series. I can say I will probably love Feyre by the end of it all. She shows signs of hope. But man, am I invested in this world! Take me away, Ms. Maas.

R2U6690NOTNEAO,One of those books I wish I could read again for the first time,"“To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”  I think ACOTAR is the perfect first book but I think ACOMAF is probably the best book in the series. It is my absolute favorite for so many reasons. Maas does this amazing job of showcasing just how much Under the Mountain impacted Feyre. We have her clearly struggling with some serious PTSD... and Tamlin... well.. per the norm is oblivious. Ianthe, a new character, and a Priestess becomes an annoyance. Lucien... well he seems less like a friend and more like Tamlin's lackey. I think it's all these things... and watching Feyre beg to be let in and be a part of things that just makes you hate all of them.  However, it's okay because all of this causes Rhys to enter the narrative in the most dramatic way humanly possible. We then get her visits which are a requirement of the bargain she made. Rhys begins to show us a side we didn't get before and quickly works his way into the reader's heart. Especially with the stark contrast to Tamlin in this one. We get the back and forth between Night Court and Spring Court, a dramatic shift for Feyre, and then an intense narrative. One in which romance is important, but like now we have the threat of war from Hybern.  I adore this book because I think it has amazing character development and even shows us parts of characters we were blind to before. Feyre slowly goes from this broken creature to this powerful Fae. It's a beautiful transition to watch happen. Not to mention the found family vibes in this one. I think Rhys has a court which works so well together and one in which Feyre easily fits in. I have to say the Night Court is probably my favorite part of this story. Even as a reread this book had me in my feels. It turns out it was almost like reading it again for the first time.  Maas really knows how to play on the emotions and she has the uncanny ability to hold it all until the end. I think this one is probably one of my favorites though because we get a lot of big reveals throughout and then the end is just this masterpiece where you are constantly ready to scream, cry, laugh and throw things. I think this one is high on my list of books I wish I could read for the first time again.

R383R2274ULMKC,This One Was Good,"*****Spoilers*****  This book was so much more than I expected but am I glad I decided to give the story a chance after the first one. The beginning of this one is slow and Feyre spends a lot of time being a broken mess from her time under the care of Amarantha. Those internal scars don't heal easily and it shows though I will admit I was disappointed that Feyre's spirit was broken so much from it. Tamlin's overprotective nature ended up driving Feyre away and with the panic of being held captive overriding her senses and making her physically ill, it's one too many and Rhys comes for Feyre as she panics just before marrying Tamlin.  Thank you Rhys for coming to the rescue. I couldn't understand why Feyre was so resentful of Rhys in the first book or in this one. Bad image aside, he'd actually done so much for Feyre I was stupified as to why she didn't see it. Getting to meet the real members of Rhys's inner circle as well as understanding his character first hand was more than enough to put me firmly in his camp though I was already there anyway. I would have liked to see Rhys unleashing his powers more often but Rhys keeps it contained for the most part. Except when an insult to Feyre leads him to break bones and fingers, brutal in the intensity Rhys is capable of and different from what we see from him in the book up to that point. It wasn't overdone to the point of distaste either so Rhys isn't a monster afterward.  I love when Rhys and Feyre finally, finally connect after months of attraction simmering between them at the Winter Court. I didn't like the whore or traitor labels Feyre ascribed to herself while she's with Rhys and thinking about how she turned away from Tamlin and in such a short time. It's understandable I think to be a little confused given she loved Tamlin and had spent time so much time at the Spring Court but I was still exasperated. Probably because I just wanted her to suck it up and move on to Rhys. Speaking of different courts, I think she and Rhys definitely should have approached the Summer Court differently. I hoped they'd ask the whole time up to when they finally broke in to get the book because making an enemy if summer just wasn't really necessary though trusting the other high lords would mean so much.  I like that Feyre has powers across the seven courts and is learning how to use them and fight both physically and with those powers. Rhys seems to have had a hand in making sure the high lords were okay with imbuing her with their powers so that she'd live in the first book. Rhys's actions from book one are explained which does nothing except endear him to me even more. I was surprised he knew early on that Feyre was his mate but felt that he didn't deserve her at all and let her stay with Tamlin. The disappearing notes were just another sweet way to win him the girl. Mates could be explained some in this book, that was missing and other than a mention here and there, information was scant. That Rhys and Feyre split up so early in their mating was also strange given what we're told about how mating affects the Fae males and they had much less than a week together for it. I'd have liked if their solo interlude lasted longer. Rhys and Feyre also talked about having kids which is not what I'm used to and it was good different I thought.  The inner circle was impressive. Azriel and Amren were scary which is good for Feyre and Rhys. Once the fighting started, I would have loved to get more of what Azriel and Amren did in terms of damage. I wasn't surprised the mortal queens gave up Rhys's sanctuary but I was happy the one gave them the book in the end.  The enemy king was scary powerful. I didn't understand how he could defeat almost all of Rhys's inner circle so easily and handily. He also wasn't as brutal as I expected either, nor did he ensure his enemies were killed. The scene with the mortal queens made no sense to me why there was such a large audience that hadn't been slaughtered. Too I didn't like that Feyre's sisters were transformed into Fae women by the cauldron. In this case, it's too convenient and Feyre loses some of what makes her special in the land of the Fae. I'm not sure how she's going to live with Tamlin again as his betrothed when she's already mated to Rhys, it seems a disaster in the making but she is set up in the right place to be a spy. I also love that Feyre's bond with Rhys can't be broken, I was afraid of what it meant when I thought it could be severed.",1635575583,"<span>*****Spoilers*****<br><br>This book was so much more than I expected but am I glad I decided to give the story a chance after the first one.

RZJC1DBWD4YM,A Masterclass in Psychological Suspense - Prepare to Be Utterly Floored,"Brace yourself, because ""The Housemaid"" is a novel that will keep you glued to the pages from start to finish, constantly questioning everything you think you know. Just when you believe you've unraveled the twisted narrative, author Freida McFadden pulls the rug out from under you, leaving you breathless and craving more. This book is a true masterclass in psychological suspense that demands to be devoured in a single, uninterrupted sitting.  From the opening chapters, McFadden weaves an intricate web of mystery and deceit, introducing readers to a cast of complex characters and a seemingly idyllic suburban setting that harbors dark secrets beneath its pristine veneer. The story's central figure, the enigmatic housemaid Millie, is a captivating presence, her motivations and allegiances constantly shifting, keeping you guessing about her true nature until the very end.  As the plot unfolds, the tension ratchets up with each turn of the page, as McFadden deftly plants seeds of doubt and suspicion, forcing you to question the reliability of every character's perspective. Just when you think you've pieced together the puzzle, she expertly upends your assumptions, leaving you reeling and eagerly devouring the next twist or revelation.  What truly sets ""The Housemaid"" apart, however, is its ability to not only shock and surprise but also to delve into the depths of human psychology and the complexities of familial relationships. McFadden's exploration of themes such as trust, loyalty, and the lengths to which people will go to protect their loved ones adds a compelling emotional layer to the narrative, making the characters and their plights resonate long after the final page.  From the meticulously crafted plot to the richly developed characters and the haunting atmospheric backdrop, every element of ""The Housemaid"" is a testament to McFadden's skill as a writer. She masterfully keeps you off-balance, constantly second-guessing your assumptions and reveling in the delicious uncertainty that permeates every chapter.  In the end, this book is an absolute must-read for fans of psychological thrillers and suspense novels. It's a true page-turner in every sense of the word, a book that will keep you captivated from start to finish, leaving you breathless and utterly floored by its brilliant execution.

R1CVPX5376U2K4,Interesting Story of Deception But Not as Addictive as Advertised,"The Housemaid by Frieda McFadden is basically a story about two women - Millie Galloway and Nina Winchester. Millie is a prison parolee who is down on her luck and living out of her car. Nina is the wife of a successful businessman living a life of leisure and luxury. She hires Millie to be the family maid.  Millie soon learns that Nina is a bit eccentric if not outright crazy. Millie begins to despise her shortly after she begins the job. She also develops an attraction to Nina’s “hunky” husband Andy who also is attracted to Millie. During a weekend when Nina is away, Millie and Andy, of course, attend a Broadway show and spend the night together. Millie secretly wishes that Nina would leave so she can have Andy to herself and become “queen of the house.” Eventually, following a heated vocal argument, Andy tells Nina to “get out” because he does not love her anymore. Millie appears to have gotten her wish - or does she? Every story has two sides. Once the other side becomes known the reader learns the jaw-dropping twist.  I found The Housemaid a little befuddling. They story is well written and the author cleverly disguises the actual events. But, the first half of the book goes on and on over the same territory - Millie dislikes Nina and has fantasies of winning her husband. The the next 25% the story is Nina’s version of the same situations. It gets to the point of OK, I get it already! Finally, the surprises begin to occur and things get more interesting. But, by then, you almost do not care anymore.  There is not a lot of character development and the situations are all too reminiscent to so may of a cheap romance novel. I did not find The Housemaid to be “addictive psychological thriller” rather it is an entangled mess of psychotic characters. The 3 main characters all seem unstable and delusional with no redeeming traits, although Nina, surprisingly, comes closest to being likable.",1538742578,"<span>The Housemaid by Frieda McFadden is basically a story about two women - Millie Galloway and Nina Winchester.

R1L5895WGZ2Y0K,Spoiler Free Review! An intriguing thriller!,"I can’t believe it has taken me this long to pick up The Housemaid by Fredia Mcfaddens! I was a little hesitant to pick it up since I’ve been hearing mixed reviews about but I’m glad I finally picked it up!  The Housemaid had me drawn in since the beginning, the little teaser we get before the events of the book was an intriguing start to the novel. Our main character Millie is certainly an interesting one, it was really fun to read from her perspective during the time she works for the winchesters. The events that follow her working for them and their strange behaviors really had me at the edge of my seat!  I really liked all of our characters, Millie was an amazing main character to follow and the side characters were just as good! I really liked Enzo as a side character and was happy that we get to know him a little better. Fredia Mcfaden does a really good job of writing love interest that I genuinely like (it’s a plus that the romances are considered closed door romance).  The first part of the story was good but the second part was even better! I initially thought this was going to be a four star read but after the second and third part of the book my rating easily bumped up to a five star! The twist and outcome were just so good, the little epilogue is an interesting end.  Overall, I finished this book in about a day! It was hard to put down, I’ll definitely be continuing on with this series!",1538742578,"<span>I can’t believe it has taken me this long to pick up The Housemaid by Fredia Mcfaddens!

R3BPTMOQDNIBYB,"Enjoyable read, didn’t want to set it down, excellently executed","This book was the first I’ve read in a long time that pulled me in and made me not want to set it down. I often find myself bored with new books I try out, and move on after a few chapters, especially with authors that aren’t already familiar to me. But this one kept me engrossed all the way through. Frieda McFadden isn’t new to me anymore; I plan to start the next book as soon as I finish this review. The title tells you there’s a twist, but knowing it’s there, even guessing what it would be, doesn’t make it any less absorbing. The protagonists are women and you read from their point of view, but these are not wish-washy, helpless women. You do not have to wade through useless, detailed descriptions of their outfits or appearance, which always bores me. I really appreciated that author kept to the details that are pertinent to the plot, rather than seeming to indulge in a personal fantasy through her characters, which turns me off of many female authors. I’m a female reader, but I want to read a good story, not someone else’s daydream about outfits, appearance, status, shoes, blah, blah, blah. She didn’t leave any glaring holes in the plot that require suspending disbelief in spite of the fact that it involves a type of life that seems too good to be true. Although I usually prefer novels with multiple subplots and extensive character backstories, very much of those would have ruined this one. There is enough of that to make the plot work well, and more would have detracted from it. I believe the more streamlined plot will likely make this book appealing to readers who prefer less convoluted stories as well as still engaging those of us who usually tend to enjoy more involved ones. Made the subscription to Kindle Unlimited totally worth it. I may not have found this book & given it a try otherwise. I’ll be reading anything else she’s written whether it’s included in Unlimited or not. Definitely recommend.",1538742578,"<span>This book was the first I’ve read in a long time that pulled me in and made me not want to set it down.

Working here is my last chance to start fresh. I can pretend to be whoever I like. But I’ll soon learn that the Winchesters’ secrets are far more dangerous than my own…  Every day I clean the Winchesters’ beautiful house top to bottom. I collect their daughter from school. And I cook a delicious meal for the whole family before heading up to eat alone in my tiny room on the top floor.  I try to ignore how Nina makes a mess just to watch me clean it up. How she tells strange lies about her own daughter. And how her husband Andrew seems more broken every day. But as I look into Andrew’s handsome brown eyes, so full of pain, it’s hard not to imagine what it would be like to live Nina’s life. The walk-in closet, the fancy car, the perfect husband.  I only try on one of Nina’s pristine white dresses once. Just to see what it’s like. But she soon finds out… and by the time I realize my attic bedroom door only locks from the outside, it’s far too late.  But I reassure myself: the Winchesters don’t know who I really am.  They don’t know what I’m capable of…  My Thoughts:  The journey with The Housemaid kept me turning pages rapidly. Back and forth we go, trying to figure out the secrets that will keep the characters on their toes.  I thought my favorite was Millie, but then the story flips and we learn more about Nina. Nothing is quite what it seems.  Will Nina turn out to be a character we enjoy, too?

So, imagine her surprise when she’s hired. However, her first day on the job, her employer’s true colors come through. One thing our heroine learned during her employment is that behind the facade of the rich and powerful lies a multitude of lies and deceit. Not everything is as it seems.

RWPEPXNPRD9NV,Plodding murder mystery,"Stories about sleuthing clerics are nothing new, Father Brown being perhaps the best known. But one written by an actual Church of England vicar – albeit one who is a former Communard and a regular on radio and TV panel shows – is a bit different.  Canon Daniel Clements wants to bring the parish of Champton St Mary up to date by installing a toilet at the back of the church. Members of the congregation, in particular the powerful Flower Guild, are opposed. Perhaps an unlikely background to murder but still…  The story plays out in a sort of timeless Middle England, although the cultural references place it firmly in the 1980s. Champton may not be St Mary Mead but there’s more than a hint of Miss Marple here in the depiction of the undercurrents and rivalries of village life.  The writing is quite good with some nice descriptive passages but the pace is doggedly pedestrian. You’re about a third of the way in before anyone gets killed and even as you approach the denouement it continues at a steady plod. There are a lot of rather two-dimensional characters many of whom don’t bring much, if anything, to the plot. In fact Daniel’s dogs are more fully rounded than some of the human players. It doesn’t really work well as a whodunnit either as there are few hints at the identity of the killer.  I was looking forward to reading this but I have to say it left me rather disappointed. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that if it didn’t have a celebrity name attached it might have struggled to find a publisher.",1474612644,"<span>Stories about sleuthing clerics are nothing new, Father Brown being perhaps the best known.

R3P5G6NZUR85U1,Cosy crime in need of a caffe ristretto,"As I love crime novels – Ann Cleeves, Peter Lovesey, Anthony Horowitz, Elly Griffiths - I really wanted to like this, but it was disappointing.  There’s plenty of expert advice online for a budding author wanting to know how to get published in crime fiction, such as, “be clear about the time period, and don’t overwhelm your readers with too many characters in the early chapters.” Oops. Here, the decade in which the plot unfolds is unclear from the get go, which is disconcerting. And so many villagers are thrown at you at the beginning that the book only becomes a page turner when you start flicking backwards to find out who they all are. When the first murder took place, I couldn’t immediately place who the victim was. The murder itself was an event so long coming that in the meantime I began to come up with alternative titles for the book. Then there’s the problem with the main protagonist - Canon Clement. Proactive he is not. Two thirds of the way through, his mother comments on how good at detecting he is when, to my mind, he hasn’t done any.  Now I really like the Reverend Richard Coles and he has a winning writing style, but his publisher has done him a disservice by not being strict enough in the editing. If this manuscript had arrived anonymously in the slush pile, would it have got this far this quickly? For a first-time fiction author, the potential is there, so why wasn’t there more input to make this, the Reverend Coles’ first book, the best it could be? I’m merely a reader but I can see the flaws, so what blinded the publishers to them? Could it be they rushed everything through hoping for instant success on the back of Richard Osman’s excellent Thursday Club series? Well, it worked in a way because this book is a best seller. What it isn’t is a page turner.  If Weidenfield and Nicolson want a successful series, they’d better get a grip, otherwise, they’ll leave themselves open to the charge that the obvious answer to the budding author’s question of how to get published in crime fiction, is “First become a celebrity.”",1474612644,"<span>As I love crime novels – Ann Cleeves, Peter Lovesey, Anthony Horowitz, Elly Griffiths - I really wanted to like this, but it was disappointing.<br><br>There’s plenty of expert advice online for a budding author wanting to know how to get published in crime fiction, such as, “be clear about the time period, and don’t overwhelm your readers with too many characters in the early chapters.” Oops.

RLUGHAH1BQWQ4,Colleen Hoover's best book to date.,"I'll start my review with a confession - I'm a Colleen Hoover fan. A big one. Huge in fact. I've loved all the books she has written up until now, with each one making me think ""wow, that's her best book yet. I love these characters"" and ""It doesn't get any better than this"". And therein lies my problem. My fear in fact, that at some point, I'm going to pick up her new book and just think ""oh"", that I'm going to be disappointed, feel that I'm missing the intensity of Hopeless, the character connection of Slammed or the romance of Maybe Someday. No one is capable of writing novel after novel that just keep getting better and better, right?  Wrong.  In my opinion, Ugly Love is Colleen Hoover's best book to date. I was instantly drawn to the characters, wanted to find out more of their story and share their emotions with them as I turned every page of this incredible book. It is an utterly beautiful story. Let me try to explain why I love it so much...  We already know from the book's blurb that Miles Archer is not your typical Hoover lead character. Not looking for love, with a ban on questions regarding his past and promising no future HEA, he's hardly Prince Charming material and could, in all honesty, come across as cold, clinical and somewhat heartless. The genius of the book is the balance you get with the alternating chapters. We skip effortlessly between present day, told from our female lead Tate's POV, to chapters written from an eighteen year old Miles, some six years previously. It is in these flashback chapters that we meet the real Miles. This warm, open, loveable, heart-on-his-sleeve eighteen year old, who is so ready to give and receive love, shows us that deep down, present day Miles is not the cold, emotionless character we have been led to believe. Given that Miles was once such an incredibly warm and loving guy, we can only speculate that something unbearably painful must have happened for him to close down emotionally in the way he has. It is this fact that draws you to the character, and keeps us with him throughout the book. I found myself reading the present day chapters, hoping against hope that glimpses of the old Miles would shine through, and of course, every now and then they did, before he would catch himself and reign himself in. As much as I loved the flashback chapters and the joy of seeing such a loveable, poetic side to Miles, I must confess, I read them with a growing sense of dread as I waited to find out just what could have happened in his life to change him so drastically.  I loved Miles, I truly did, but there were also times when I was so mad at him for the, albeit unintentional, pain he put Tate through. Tate Collins is a fantastic character. Independent, kind, warm and fun, we get to see all sides of her via her various relationships, be it her good humoured, sibling bickering with Corbin or her hilarious and touching interactions with Cap (seriously, who writes the BFF for their female lead as an 80 year old male lift attendant?! Genius!!) to her intense attraction to the dark and moody Miles. Tate is an every girl and I think this is why we love her. From the moment the connection is made with Miles and the ground rules are laid out, you hope that she will be able to follow them without getting emotionally attached and hurt but you fear that may prove impossible. I think sometimes we try to kid ourselves. Hold an internal chat that says ""this is going to be fine, we can do this"" whereas deep down, we know we are lying to ourselves. This is why Tate is so real to me and where I think Colleen's writing excels. The hurt, embarrassment and anguish you feel for Tate during this book is so brilliantly observed and wonderfully written, that your heart breaks for her again and again. I fully expect some readers will criticise Tate's character for being weak, but I think she's far from that. I just find her reactions so true to life. Now I agree, in real life, if Tate were my best friend, and she told me all about her relationship with Miles, I would be advising her to run for the hills, to find someone more deserving of her love and to move on. However, come on, we've all been there, haven't we? When you are the person in the relationship, it is not so easy to just detach your emotions and follow the cold, logical path, is it? We would be robots if that were the case. People make their own decisions, right or wrong, based on emotion and feelings, and that's the type of character I want to read about in my novels, not someone who behaves as though they live their life following The Optimum Relationship Guide for Dummies manual.  I really do not want to give away much of the actual storyline, so I'll say no more about how the book unfolds. I will just say this story has a different feel to it from other Colleen Hoover books. It's a little darker, not containing quite the amount of humour we've seen in her other books although there are light moments, particularly involving the brilliant Cap. It's certainly sexier without being unnecessarily graphic. Even in her sex scenes, there's a wonderful truth to how she writes. I mean honestly, how often in other stories have you read that the hero ""rips off"" the girl's panties and though ""Really? What were they made of, paper? I'm quite sure mine wouldn't give way so easily without first doing an impression of a cheese cutter slicing through a lump of Cheddar"", so I love her for injecting some humour into that scene.  Ugly Love is a gorgeous book that both broke my heart and had me crying with joy. Emotional, poetic, gut-wrenching, beautiful and oh so real, it goes to the very top of my favourite books of 2014 list.",1471136728,"<span>I'll start my review with a confession - I'm a Colleen Hoover fan.

R2AS94927PAWA6,I really hate to give a CoHo book anything but 5 stars,"I really hate to give a CoHo book anything but 5 stars, but, it is what it is..  For starters, I really did end up enjoying the story. It took me a while to get there, with a lot of frustrations and irritations along the way, but by 70% or so I found myself zooming through the pages, dying to know where the story was leading to. It's just unfortunate it took nearly three quarters of the book to get there..  For a lot of the book I felt like it was going to be your typical friends with benefits story that will ultimately lead to a relationship and everybody would live happily ever after.. yeah, I couldn't have been more wrong. Upon meeting there is an undeniable attraction between Miles and Tate. They both want each other, but neither of them want anymore than that. No strings sex is their agreement, with only two rules to follow.  ""Don't ask about my past, and never expect a future.""  Of course Tate agrees to this, never believing that it would come back to bite her on the arse.  I found it pretty repetitive at times. There's only so many times you can read about two people sneaking around, having sex, denying their feelings and repeating.. I know I should enjoy the build up, the anticipation, but for whatever reason it just felt too much here. Miles was keeping major secrets about his past from Tate, which explain why he is so against love and relationships, but I was getting fed up waiting to find out what they were. I felt like I needed to skim/skip to get to the juicy parts, which happened around 70%. Once we got to that part I was hooked and couldn't stop reading until I finished. Those last chapters are what stopped me rating this book only 3 stars. They were brilliant. Beautifully written and so emotional that I was in tears. It was what I had been waiting for throughout the whole book.  ""If I were capable of loving someone.. It would be you.""  My biggest dislike throughout the book was the writing style. It's not the fact that it's written in dual POV or that the book is told in both past and present. My issue was the way in which the past chapters, in Miles' POV were written. I have no idea the real term for it, but I will just refer to it as 'poem style writing'. I do not wish to read a book written with words on random lines. So, I guess I am crap at poems, but that was exactly how the book was written in my eyes. I found his chapters so distracting being written like that and it really put me off the book. I didn't enjoy them at all, which is a shame because Miles' past was the most interesting aspect of the story. I just couldn't connect to him with the writing as it was.  Overall I did enjoy this book, even though it took me a while, I would just prefer to read books in a normal writing style in future.",1471136728,"<span>I really hate to give a CoHo book anything but 5 stars, but, it is what it is..<br><br>For starters, I really did end up enjoying the story.

R1BVLMGZ5QC8E6,I needed more of Miles and Tate together,"This was my second book i've read from this author, the other was ‘it ends with us’, and i did actually prefer this book more as i felt more angst and pain in this read than i did with the other.. i cried with this one and i never did with it ends with us.  I really liked Miles, i adored his love story with his first love and found myself anxious to get to his chapters where he shared his past with rachel as i knew it must’ve been something so awful to pull them apart, that i wasn’t actually sure if i wanted to find out what it was that happened between them to end what they had. He was seriously smitten with her and she really was his everything. They both had a rare kind of love that hurt to think Tate would never get to experience that beautiful side of what Miles’ had to give, and even though she got something back from him in the end, we know it never really compared to what he gave to rachel. That side of his love, sweetness and romance seemed to be reserved for Rachel and Rachel alone, even Tate and Miles’ ending confirmed that for me and i don’t really know how i feel about that… I felt like Rachel and their baby still overshadowed Tate in everything she eventually got to share with Miles😞  Something in Miles’ and Rachel’s love died and it brought darkness and resentment that in their young, slightly naive and immaturity (due to their age and life experience) i don’t think they would have ever been able to heal together and did prove to be something that needed to be worked on apart before they where able to give each other the closure they both needed and deserved. I didn’t really want to fall for the love story of Miles and Rachel because i knew they weren’t going to be end game but i really couldn’t help it. The more i read about them the more guilty i felt that i adored what they had ( i kind of felt like i was betraying Tate in a way, for thinking more of his other love story than i did for miles and hers) I really didn’t want to see that side of Miles and what he was capable of being like while in the present day he was disrespecting Tate so badly. I do feel like if Rachel was still an option, Miles would’ve always stood by her. That’s not to say that probably their love would never of turned to something dark and toxic based on the grief and anger they shared (rachel’s anger towards miles and miles’ anger towards himself) but i do believe that he still would’ve always stuck by rachel, even if what they had did turn to something unhealthy, he would’ve passionately loved her till the very end. It was Rachel who took the option of them ever moving forward together off the table. I wish we had more sweeter moments in miles and Tate’s build up. It was just all pushing and no pulling… Tate pushing for more with Miles and miles pushing away Tate.. until it was just Tate pushing and miles finally stopped pushing back and just started to except what she had to give. Even on their wedding day.. we didn’t really need to know he didn’t cry with happiness, that still could’ve been saved for the day of their baby’s birth but his happiness didn’t need to be down played in order to hype up his feelings for his arrival of baby number 2. i felt like the little we got of Tate and miles’ happy ending all got down played for that one moment at the end and they welcomed the baby arrival. Like the proposal was sweet but that’s all it was… sweet. i felt so much more emotion and passion in what he had to give to Rachel, it was sad we never got to see that with Tate too. We never got the emotional moment of appreciation towards Tate making him a father again, how it felt to see her as a first time mum in that moment, but we sure got all of that during Rachel and Miles’ moment in the hospital together. we got so much from the birth of his son and all we got from the birth of his daughter was him holding back yet again. just highlighting yet another special moment of admiration and appreciation he had for rachel that he seems to have just reserved for her alone and the type of relationship she had with him that Tate would never get a taste off.  Miles seemed to be Tates first everything that truly matters in life, her first love, first marriage, first to experience the path of parenthood together. The wedding being something that was just theirs.. an experience just for them and something special between the two of them should’ve been so much more… especially if the birth of their first child together was going to be less personal to them and just another thing that gets over shadowed by his past and Rachel. Tate would’ve been feeling so much during that moment too, knowing he was holding back again during another intimate moment of theirs.. was just a bit crappy and it’s sad that he wasn’t the one to give the reassurance during that time when he gave rachel so much of it during their first baby’s birth😞 it was Tate yet again talking him round to allow himself to feel the moment. He had so many special moment with his first born, that was special to just him & Rachel, why couldn’t tate have that too? i just never felt that passion, admiration and happiness the second time around. He just always gave Rachel MORE.. more when they met more when they fell in love more when they became pregnant more when they became a family and finally more when they reunited for her to give him the much needed closure in order for him to be able to give himself the permission he thought he needed to even give Tate a chance.  Even though i really did love this book.. just like Tate deserved, i feel like we deserved and needed more of them together! and maybe a little less of Rachel and Miles but 100% more of Miles and Tate because in the end i felt more sorry for what Rachel and miles lost than happiness for what Miles gained in having Tate🥺 i felt like the author was so careful to not downplay what Rachel and Miles shared and experience that she downplayed too much of Tate and miles’ relationship and that’s such a shame because after what Miles went through.. his happy ending deserved to be so much MORE too❤️",1471136728,"<span>This was my second book i've read from this author, the other was ‘it ends with us’, and i did actually prefer this book more as i felt more angst and pain in this read than i did with the other.. i cried with this one and i never did with it ends with us.<br><br>I really liked Miles, i adored his love story with his first love and found myself anxious to get to his chapters where he shared his past with rachel as i knew it must’ve been something so awful to pull them apart, that i wasn’t actually sure if i wanted to find out what it was that happened between them to end what they had.<br>He was seriously smitten with her and she really was his everything.<br>They both had a rare kind of love that hurt to think Tate would never get to experience that beautiful side of what Miles’ had to give, and even though she got something back from him in the end, we know it never really compared to what he gave to rachel. That side of his love, sweetness and romance seemed to be reserved for Rachel and Rachel alone, even Tate and Miles’ ending confirmed that for me and i don’t really know how i feel about that…<br>I felt like Rachel and their baby still overshadowed Tate in everything she eventually got to share with Miles😞<br><br>Something in Miles’ and Rachel’s love died and it brought darkness and resentment that in their young, slightly naive and immaturity (due to their age and life experience) i don’t think they would have ever been able to heal together and did prove to be something that needed to be worked on apart before they where able to give each other the closure they both needed and deserved.<br>I didn’t really want to fall for the love story of Miles and Rachel because i knew they weren’t going to be end game but i really couldn’t help it. The more i read about them the more guilty i felt that i adored what they had ( i kind of felt like i was betraying Tate in a way, for thinking more of his other love story than i did for miles and hers) I really didn’t want to see that side of Miles and what he was capable of being like while in the present day he was disrespecting Tate so badly.<br>I do feel like if Rachel was still an option, Miles would’ve always stood by her. That’s not to say that probably their love would never of turned to something dark and toxic based on the grief and anger they shared (rachel’s anger towards miles and miles’ anger towards himself) but i do believe that he still would’ve always stuck by rachel, even if what they had did turn to something unhealthy, he would’ve passionately loved her till the very end.<br>It was Rachel who took the option of them ever moving forward together off the table.<br>I wish we had more sweeter moments in miles and Tate’s build up. It was just all pushing and no pulling… Tate pushing for more with Miles and miles pushing away Tate.. until it was just Tate pushing and miles finally stopped pushing back and just started to except what she had to give.<br>Even on their wedding day.. we didn’t really need to know he didn’t cry with happiness, that still could’ve been saved for the day of their baby’s birth but his happiness didn’t need to be down played in order to hype up his feelings for his arrival of baby number 2.<br>i felt like the little we got of Tate and miles’ happy ending all got down played for that one moment at the end and they welcomed the baby arrival.<br>Like the proposal was sweet but that’s all it was… sweet.<br>i felt so much more emotion and passion in what he had to give to Rachel, it was sad we never got to see that with Tate too.

R1YM98RJEMNSO3,I'm so conflicted about this book.,"I was curious enough to download this book after watching the teaser trailer starring Nick Bateman as Miles Archer. It left me SO conflicted. Part of me wanted to love it and another part of me wanted to tear it to shreds. I finished it yesterday and I'm still torn over how I feel about it. If I read it with my heart I think I'd love it, but I couldn't leave my head at the door and that pulled me in a different direction.  I'd never read any of Hoover's books before, so the writing style was a complete surprise to me. I'm going to put my hand up to the fact that I'd assumed she was like dozens of other writers in this field, but I was pleasantly surprised. Her writing is both lyrical and conceptual and I really loved that about it. I loved the way she plays with ideas of liquid and solid and describes the irresistible draw between two people who are that attracted to each other. It seduced my brain in ways it hasn't been since I last read something by Tiffany Reisz.  I loved Tate as a lead character. Despite her helplessness in the face of her feelings, she's strong and vibrant and sassy in a lot of ways. She's no vapid doormat. She knows her mind and she's okay with who she is, despite her moments of vulnerability. I liked that she could see Miles' behaviour as unfair and she even mentions red flags a couple of times in the book and that gives her extra credit as far as I'm concerned. I was emotionally engaged with her and rooting for her. Her internal turmoil is both painful and realistic and absorbing. I liked that she didn't judge anyone (except Dillon, who totally deserved it) and her friendship with Cap is one of the best threads throughout the story.  The cast of supporting characters are also really good. Dillon is superbly and shamelessly creepy. Corbin is a typical big brother and his character rings as truly authentic. I know this because my brother was exactly the same and I didn't date for 9 years. 9 YEARS. Thanks Stuart. Really. Thanks. *facepalm*. That blend of unfair dictation and love is realistic and it was great. Cap is also brilliant - I love his lame jokes and the wisdom he imparts. I'm still laughing over the interrupting cow joke.  This is erotica and while the sex scenes are really well written, they're not so hot and steamy that you get flustered reading them. In a weird way, that's one of the strengths of this book. Because they're not so captivating, they're not the whole focus of the plot. The emotion is. It's a fine line to walk and I think Hoover captures that balance brilliantly.  I think what caused the conflict for me was Miles Archer, the main male character. The way he was written, I really wanted to like him. He's obviously damaged and Hoover didn't go anywhere near that hideous trope of abuse being disguised as love. She wrote him really well. He doesn't claim it's love, he doesn't hide what he is and he makes no excuses for it. He's up front and honest about what he feels he's capable of giving and even when he acts in an unpleasant way, they both knew it was coming. That's where the emotional turmoil is so great - Tate can't help feeling let down but she knows it's because she set herself up for it by wanting what he promised he couldn't give. The problem I have with him is that I didn't buy his reason for being the way that he is. I get that his back story was traumatic but I just didn't feel like it translated into his current mindset.  If I can't buy his damaged back story, then it means that he's just acting like a dick in the present.  And that's where I'm conflicted. Because I really wanted to like him. I felt for him. I wanted him to change, to open his heart, to let it go. I felt sad for him because of his past and the story in the present is so well written that I wanted to give it my whole hearted approval. There was just something missing for me.  I'll maybe feel differently in a few days, I don't know. On the plus side, I'll go and see the film and I'm definitely going to download other books by this author because I have a feeling she could be a new favourite.  Would I recommend it to other readers? Yes, I would. Especially if you read erotica anyway. It's a fresh look at a genre that sorely needs it.",1471136728,"<span>I was curious enough to download this book after watching the teaser trailer starring Nick Bateman as Miles Archer.

R150A7O1I1EQES,Feminine Power,"Normally, I avoid ‘celebrity’ books - they bring me out in a rash. However, I find Paloma Faith an interesting character. And this book doesn’t disappoint. Partially, is an attempt to reclaim the word and give it a positive spin. But that is only partially the purpose of it.  She is brutally honest about her own sexuality, miscarriage, motherhood, IVF, the break up of the relationship with her children’s Dad and her own life. Mixed in with that, is her perceptions for what it is like being a woman artist, raising two kids as a single parent and contrasting her own life with her Mother’s.  In broader terms, she talks about her own hopes for what the future of feminism looks like. And if that is the intention of this book - one that changes the world - time will tell. But it’s that non-linear, snapshot settle of the book that shouldn’t work, does. Paloma Faith has added her another string to her bow in being such a skilled, candid and funny writer.  It is a pleasant surprise to find something that is both glitzy and gritty.

R6Z1MGAY07OLR,MILF,"MILF by Paloma Faith (Motherhood, Identity, Love and F*ckery) Rating: 3/5 Release Date: 6 June 2024  In this impassioned, witty, and bold manifesto, Paloma Faith delves into the myriad challenges confronting women today. From navigating puberty and sexual awakening to confronting the pressures of patriarchy and the myth of the Supermum, she fearlessly explores these issues.  Infused with Paloma's trademark humour and unfiltered honesty, the book offers a poignant reflection on the struggles of IVF and the early stages of motherhood, celebrating the often unseen labor of women.  Transitioning from discussions on identity and the impact of motherhood to the elusive concept of being a 'good mother,' Paloma advocates for embracing imperfection and prioritising self-care. She shares her own journey of growth alongside her mother, highlighting the evolution of parent-child relationships into adulthood.  Through Paloma's personal anecdotes, readers glimpse the complexities of balancing romantic love, heartbreak, and dating with the responsibilities of motherhood, offering a nuanced portrayal of life's joys and challenges.  Despite my initial anticipation, I found myself disappointed upon reading this book. While I expected a personal exploration of Paloma's experiences, it felt more like a one-sided sermon directed at the reader. The lack of interaction between Paloma and the audience left me feeling as though she was solely focused on imposing her opinions rather than fostering a meaningful connection.  Although the book is a quick read, I'm hesitant to recommend it based on my own experience.",1529937647,"<span>MILF by Paloma Faith<br>(Motherhood, Identity, Love and F*ckery)<br>Rating: 3/5<br>Release Date: 6 June 2024<br><br>In this impassioned, witty, and bold manifesto, Paloma Faith delves into the myriad challenges confronting women today.

R1WUA5IO7CW89T,Honestly the most shocking true story I’ve read,"I’m a big reader (maybe 4-5 books a week most of my life) and I’ve only ever reviewed I think two! But I can’t get Louise’s story out of my mind. The strength, endurance, courage and heartbreak she has endured shocked me. I’m not the greatest fan of social media because we all end up ‘comparing’ ourselves, our homes, our size, health, children etc. But what I found so utterly compelling about this book and Louise’s story is that for once - at long last - someone is truthful about the utter horror and mess they endured. I still cannot quite believe what she went through. My distrust and fear of medical negligence has never improved over the decades, and to think that in this modern world with all that is available to us, that women are left untreated, full of trauma and kind of ‘abandoned’ to get on with it themselves after giving birth is horrendous. The courage it must have taken for Louise to recount her experience so eloquently was remarkable - when you look at someone who appears to have it all, this book reminds us that we will never know the trauma and awfulness of their ‘real lives’ and that we must be kind to absolutely everyone, not to be judgmental and make hurtful snap decisions on other peoples’ lives. Thank you to Louise for being so open and honest about just how bloody awful things got before thankfully beginning to get better and for the positive way the book ends with the realisation that the challenges and changes in her life have meant that her outlook now is so very different.

R1T2COSI42NHWR,Lucky: Learning to live again by Louise Thompson,"As soon I received the book in the post on Thursday I have not be able to put it down. I'm certainly learning a lot about child birth trauma, NHS doctors, nurses, midwifes, junior doctors on their appalling behaviour, bedside, manner, refusing to listen, refusing to give you aftercare advice, doctors attitude towards women. My own father is a retired A&E consultant doctor and he was appalled by what yourself Louise went through. The rules are that before you leave hospital you need to pee, drink some water, eat something climb stairs and I only know this from when my own father was in hospital after having a knee and hernia operation. I'm proud of you doing all of your research regarding breast feeding, child birth before you had your traumatic birth experience. I hope you that make a documentary with your lovely sister in law to be in the future Zara because it will give medical professionals, a wake up call as to what goes on in Maternity hospitals. You might even learn something new regarding your health, fertility, stoma. Please watch the program that featured Alex Jones on Making Babies series 1 which is available on UK TV play, which you can download on your smart TV. Some of your health issues that you have now Louise are highlighted in one of the episodes. I will say your lovely partner husband Ryan has been an absolute rock to you whilst you going through all of this. Keep on moving forward, enjoy every special moment with your gorgeous Leo, Ryan. I wish you all the best in your health and if you do fall pregnant again go to the Portland Hospital in London, stand up for yourself, do your research, take notes, I do agree with Ryan though on not wanting to put you through another pregnancy again.

R21CFCDMBKNUUH,Was not expecting a 5⭐️ read,"When I first started this book I didn’t know if I’d like it or not, I’d heard very mixed reviews and I honestly don’t think I’ve ever read anything like it before, since I’m normally a fantasy reader. I read the first 2 chapters when it arrived from Amazon, and I stopped… largely because I was already reading another book I needed to finish. After reading those first chapters I didn’t think this book would be for me, but bestie convinced me we should tackle it together on our camping trip, so I picked it up and damned me if I couldn’t put it down.  I loved the switching POVs between Sloane and Rowan each POV distinctly different, I loved their banter and chemistry. I really enjoyed how Brynne has played out Sloane’s insecurities, showing Sloane holding her own power and owning it as her relationship with Rowan evolves. I found myself constantly amused by how cocky Rowan is, he has his own issues (duh just look at their hobby) but he wears it in a very different way to Sloane. In so many ways these characters complement each other. I also really liked how Brynne has been descriptive but not excessively gross.  I did give this a 5⭐️ rating cos I loved it so much but it’s not without its flaws. There were several moments where my immediate thought was well that’s problematic… and no it wasn’t the murder or the lengthy list of Trigger Warnings or their antics in bed, every one has their kinks… rather the ongoing casual sexism from Rowan. He literally falls in love with a serial killer, with the same mission in life, who has managed perfectly fine on her own for the most part, only for him to become insanely overprotective. I also found moments to be unrealistic such as the number of people who seem to know about their hobby or the camera in the kitchen… among other things.

R26AHVDBQGOFIZ,Audiobook review!,"𝕬𝖚𝖉𝖎𝖔𝖇𝖔𝖔𝖐 𝕽𝖊𝖛𝖎𝖊𝖜  ​I went into this not really knowing what to expect, only the warning that it could get gorey. I don’t usually go for the serial killer vibes but this story held such an interesting mix of genres- dark rom-com and I was curious! The narrators really made this the full five stars for me. The emotion and character portrayal was just spot on. I think it’s safe to say that Joe Arden’s Irish accent IS MY THING 🥵.  To say that I felt so many different emotions while reading would be an understatement. I pined, smiled, shrieked, gagged, giggled and even had a little tear. This book seemed to mash so many elements together but it worked so seamlessly. The whole serial killers that kill serial killers but fall in love vibe had me absolutely hooked. The romance and humour was all there, the romance delivering much more than I expected. Make sure to check those TW’s though because it is definitely dark and gorey, with graphic and explicit on page content (I did gag a handful of times and will not look at a tub of ice cream the same).  I don’t think I have ever read any characters quite like Rowan & Sloane. Such an intriguing mix of personality traits and past trauma. I was surprised with how invested I became in their relationship. The slow burn between them had me pining and swooning so hard. The third act spice went from warm to raging hot inferno pretty damn quick and I ate up every minute of it (not like a tub of ice-cream). The mouth on Rowan, with the Irish accent by Joe… I can’t say this enough… it was everything. I am ready to sell my husband on the black market just to upgrade to someone with THAT VOICE. Feckin’ eejit!  Overall this was a fantastic read, unlike anything I’d ever read before! Highly recommend the audiobook!",0349441561,"<span>𝕬𝖚𝖉𝖎𝖔𝖇𝖔𝖔𝖐 𝕽𝖊𝖛𝖎𝖊𝖜<br><br>​I went into this not really knowing what to expect, only the warning that it could get gorey.

RAALLER2O9ASO,4.5☆ Dark Romcom is my new love 🖤,"I loved this book way more than I thought I would. This book has a little of everything all rolled into one. Rowan was just the sweetest book bf. I loved him with Sloana and vice versa. This book had me cackling more than anything fhe humor was top notch 💕 I can't wait for the brothers books.  Their paths cross in an unlikely way. He's The Boston Butcher, and she's The Orb Weaver. Two known serial kill3rs. But one thing sets them apart. Their victims. They only hunt serial kill3rs, unsolved cases. Butcher finds his Blackbird locked in a cage that her latest target managed to get her in b4 he kicked the bucket with her knif3 lodged in his throat. Butcher obviously frees her, and they go to dinner. Naturally. They start up a yearly competition, once a year they're given a destination and then they have to research and track down the serial kill3r in that area. The first one to find them wins and gets to unalive the target. Best out of 5. So they meet each year, but each time gets harder to walk away and return back to their lives. They never expected to find someone who sees the darker twisted side of them, and it makes them feel like coming home. But who says serial kill3rs can't find love too and what could be more fun than taking them down together. Hallmark probably won't look to them for inspiration on their next big hit, but who needs sweet love stories when you can sweet bl00dy moments with a side of homemade cookies and cream ice cream.

R1DVK0HKMEHTZN,Amazing read but not for the squeamish,"I was a little hesitant going into this one because I keep my expectations low with dark romance that is also claimed to be a comedy. Brynne 100% fulfilled this, I was laughing and grossed out at the same time. This book hit me right in my black little heart and dark sense of humour. You will honestly go from cringing one moment to laughing out loud the next.  Sloan and Rowan play off each other perfectly. Their characters are not written to be over-the-top quirky, they are blessedly balanced and just have some odd urges that they have chosen to utilize in a way that benefits the community. I absolutely adore their banter and throwing in Lark and Rowan's brothers just takes it to the next level.  This is definitely a slow burn and honestly, a bit of a slow build up but once we get the momentum the story just flows from one emotion to the next. Once we get to those spicey scenes, OH MY GOSH! Rowan flips a switch and is completely on! This, thankfully, doesn't take over the whole plot and everything keeps moving along, even if their relationship does step up quite quickly from there.  Overall I highly recommend, if you take the trigger warnings seriously you will be fine because the accidental cannibalism was ok, it was the ""not so accidental"" cannibalism that got me worse. If you read this you'll see what I mean when you get there.

R1WB94QH54AUHI,The negative reviews are ironic,"This book requires a certain level of emotional intelligence to not only understand it but to also implement it. I’ve read the negative reviews, all of them indicate a lack of EI or understanding. The one that said it isn’t an emotional development book because that would be “why is my child upset” well the book explains in detail why children have tantrums and difficulty controlling their emotions so it clearly addresses that.  The review that said it didn’t help their “problem child”. Well, that they’re even calling their child a problem indicates that they did not implement the strategies at all or work on themselves, I’d be certain they tried once or twice and when that didn’t work they gave up (changing the brains plasticity takes a long time, 1 day of these strategies will be fairly useless.) I also have a child with behavioural difficulties, a speech and language disorder and an anxiety disorder. He responds very well to these strategies and responds best when they are always used. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t act out, but over time I see a change in how he manages these outbursts and he’s started saying “I’m going to go over here where (my sister) can’t get to me.” Instead of hitting her.  The book is quite repetitive, but he explains things in different ways, most people require that to understand a concept, I thought it was differentiated enough to remain engaging although I did skip some of the repeated parts at the end.  There was one review calling it Fake Science. He clearly states in the book that the brain is not as simple as left/right brain but he’s simplifying it to more easily explain how the brain works and why the parenting strategies are useful. I actually agree that he shouldn’t use that terminology but that’s the only part of inaccuracy. Modern research does support the idea of unconditional love, emotional development and boundaries, with evidence suggesting that punishment causes emotional disconnect once kids become teenagers and increases the likelihood of addiction and emotional problems. Research also supports that a high emotional intelligence reduces the likelihood of addictive behaviours and destructive behaviour.  This book is not a quick fix to parenting. This is 18-25 years of solid parenting effort to see the benefits in a well adjusted adult who has the empathy and emotional understanding to handle the difficulties in life and to be able to undo any of your parenting mistakes (because we can’t be perfect!).  Pros: easy to understand, solid and supported advice, will result in stable adults. Cons: left/right brain description is misleading, this is not a quick fix and most people do not have the calm to actually implement these strategies.  If you want to also develop the calm, I suggest reading: “Raising Good Humans” or “The Headspace Guide to Meditation and Mindfulness.” The latter will do yourself as much good as your children and works well in conjunction with this book. Basically the mindsight description in this book is just how to teach children mindfulness and meditation because teaching a child is different to teaching an adult.  Hopefully this helps people. If you don’t have an open mind to changing everything you believe (if you believe in punishment as discipline, or think that “you turned out ok”) then this book will be a disappointment. But if you want to break generational trauma and create some humans that contribute to the world in a positive way instead of adding to the sadness then read away!",1921844779,"<span>This book requires a certain level of emotional intelligence to not only understand it but to also implement it.

R3EPK9J4MKGB7J,game changer for parenting,"This book has changed the way I parent. I have two daughters, 1 and 6 years old. The oldest struggles with elevated levels of anxiety to the point where we decided to have her start chatting with a pediatric therapist to help her (and us) better navigate the tough moments. Her therapist recommends that all parents read this book. I am so thankful that I did. I not only understand more about my daughter’s brain and thought process and emotions, but I also understand more about myself, and how my handling of situations has projected my own anxiety onto her. The good news is that we can actually change our brains by forming new neural pathways, and it’s never too late to start. So you can take situations that normally upset your child (anxiety, fear, anger, violence, hyersilliness, nervousness, inability to focus – truly anything) and use these occurrences to help them form new neural pathways that in turn allow them to better cope with challenges. And it’s helped me in the same way. I’ve noticed I am better able to manage high-anxiety situations in general. This book does an amazing job at explaining just enough of the science to help the concepts make logical sense. For me, this makes them easier to remember and implement. After reading this book, I *get* it. And that makes all the difference in the world when you are in an emotional moment, struggling to best navigate not only your little one’s feelings but also your own. Beyond the concepts, this book provides practical, easy to understand techniques. And darn it if they don’t work. I noticed such a rapid response with my 6-year-old that I started using some of the approaches with my 1-year-old, and there was an immediate response with her as well. Getting such quick and positive feedback makes you excited to keep using the approaches. And it’s really set up to be as easy as possible. There is a helpful “HOW TO USE THIS BOOK” section at the beginning, I’ve included some snippets in my photos. I think this book is a game changer for parenting, and I wish I had read it earlier. I recommend this to any parent, new or veteran.",,"<span>This book has changed the way I parent. I have two daughters, 1 and 6 years old. The oldest struggles with elevated levels of anxiety to the point where we decided to have her start chatting with a pediatric therapist to help her (and us) better navigate the tough moments. Her therapist recommends that all parents read this book. I am so thankful that I did. I not only understand more about my daughter’s brain and thought process and emotions, but I also understand more about myself, and how my handling of situations has projected my own anxiety onto her. The good news is that we can actually change our brains by forming new neural pathways, and it’s never too late to start.

RHMJQ5W0TK61K,ITS A PRICKLY PROBLEM ...,"Book one of this much lauded YA Fantasy series is, to put it mildly, an extraordinary reading experience. It must be said, however, that ACOTAR starts off relatively slowly. The reader is introduced to the book’s principal character - Feyre - who is a huntress who kills for her own survival and that of her family. Her father is a broken man. Crippled, both physically, financially, and metaphorically. Her mother died when she was younger. He sisters are two unloving, and facetious twats. Her brothers are something our heroine (and the story) were not blessed with.  Fate brings Fayre and a beautiful, fully grown wolf together in the sunlight dappled reaches of the nearby Forest. Destiny steps forth to convince Fayre to kill the wolf. She does so, and her life is never the same again. For the wolf she killed was anything but. Fayre is captured for the kill and punishment is either instant death, or lifelong banishment into the enemy’s kingdom. She chooses the latter to save her family, and this is where the book’s true nature takes form and steals the reader’s heart.  For this is where we meet Tamlin, and Lucien. The sworn and hated enemies who aren’t. It is easy to detest them both, but read on, and your feelings toward them will soften. Moments of breathtaking excitement and beauty follow. Chapter after chapter, after chapter, feature cliffhangers and profound plot twists, that quite literally, take your breath away, and make it impossible for the reader to put the book down. A chain of truly stupendous OMG moments leave the reader in tatters when they realise they must put the book down eventually to rejoin society. Chapter thirteen is where the book finds it’s street cred from a fantasy perspective. And chapter eighteen is a good way for the reader to determine if they are still human, and if they still have a heart than can be broken.  This book is structured, and written beautifully. Pacing is perfect, too. A harsh critic would give it four stars and say, 'its only book one of a trilogy, and you need to leave room for improvement...’ Well, I ain’t no harsh critic. This book is worth full marks, and if the rest are even better, then no doubt the world will get to hear of it. ACOTAR is the first Sarah J Maas book that i have picked up and it is truly gorgeous in just about every way imaginable. My good fortune lies in the fact that book two is less than three months away. That gives me time to read this one again (and again, and again) in readiness, or go and purchase the other titles in her world wide best selling catalog.  Either way, I can’t lose. It’s a prickly problem that I am delighted to find myself in a quandary over.

R1O29TI7R8VYX2,Definitely getting the rest of the series,"Definitely an enjoyable read that I'll be recommending to my other book loving friends.  The first half of the book I'd rate 3/5, it's a little bit slow but not in a boring way. We learn about Feyre and what a strong female lead she is, the sacrifices she has to make for her family and also about the layout of the faerie court. Great world and character building, it makes the reader feel like this is mostly a love story about overcoming difficultiws together. However, once the plot twist hits it seems more of an action/adventure and really picks up the pace.  All of the characters are likeable I'd say minus Feyre's family who really invoke frustration and anger from the reader. The main love interest isn't really that interesting in my opinion but it could be because he was only one of the many aspects of the book that drove feyre's motivation. And he may build a lot more depth in character in the next books in the series.  I still kept thinking about the book even the next day after I'd finished it which is always a positive sign for me. I'll definitely be reading the rest of the series in the near future.

RGN766INW2NW3,Slow start but has potential,"‘A Court of Thorns and Roses’ is book one in Sarah J. Maas’ A Court of Thorns and Roses series.  Feyre with her two older sisters Nesta & Elain along with their father live in a small human town that borders the wall between humans and Fae. Five hundred years ago a War broke out between Humans and Fae, which resulted in Humans living in the South of Prythian in the Mortal Lands, and the Wall built. While out Hunter Feyre kills a Fae in the form of a Wolf which results in her coming face to face with the very beings her kind have been brought up to fear.  This was a bit of a slow start, but by the 70% mark I was completely invested. I did find Feyre to be a tad naive and easily manipulated. Her family literally treated her like crap all her life, and the promise she had made I found to be utter bull. Dont get me wrong I understand that without her, her family wouldn’t not have survived as long as they had, but how is that fair to her. Feyre is strong in her own unique way, learning everything by herself makes her a stronger person. Feyre has been dealt a rare hand in this story, starving, living in poverty, living with her enemies, and so much more. Than when she is finally “happy” things go down hill even more.  I do not like Tamlin, I find him to be too secretive, manipulative, and there is something about him that just irks me. Even when things started to heat up between him and Feyre I still felt as if this was all wrong. Yes he helps her come into herself and helps her get over her “promise” but there is more behind him. Plus in what world is it ok to not want to help the one you love when they are in danger. Plus the first chance he gets when Under the Mountain to help he wants to hump away instead of escaping. Nope not ok.  Now Rhysand, well he is a different matter. I LOVE RHYSAND. Just putting it out there, I have a thing for the bad boy, he intrigues me. But there is something else under his mask that he puts out to everyone. From the moment he first meets Feyre on the hill he has done one thing after another to help her. Under the Mountain is where I really fell for him, he’s constant helping Feyre out even though it would cost him. His flirtatious banter with Feyre had me smiling and blushing.  I am hoping that like Ms Maas’ TOG series that the misunderstood, grouchy, moody, male is the love interest and not the first male as I can not stand Tamlin.  This series has serious potential and I can’t wait to see how things turn out. I off now to go and read book two.",1526605392,"<span>‘A Court of Thorns and Roses’ is book one in Sarah J.

Though because I did that I was actually able to read further and start to slowly really enjoy the book, from halfway through this book and to the end, it actually turned out to be amazing.

R1297A38LYZ0IS,I’m glad I gave it a second chance,"I originally attempted to read this book a couple of years ago and stopped reading at 66%. At the time I did not know it was a retelling of Beauty and the Beast, and so the similarities turned me off quite a bit back then, as it seemed unoriginal. However, I decided to give ACOTR another go, considering how everyone raves about this series and I’ve heard that the first book isn’t so great compared to the rest. So here I am giving it a second chance.  I again am annoyed at how awful Feyre’s family is at the beginning of the book. The interactions and description of the family dynamic can be summed up as childish, more like a Cinderella vibe with her two selfish and egotistical sisters. It just doesn’t seem realistic and is cringe worthy when reading. It makes is look like Feyre is an enabler for letting her family be lazy and for letting them get away with their juvenile behaviour. This would normally turn me off and I would not pursue reading - however, the reputation of the book convinced me to continue.  Moving on. I actually did like the part of Feyre living in the fae world and getting to know Tamlin and Lucien. As another review states, I was wary of Tamlin. He’s polite but then always seems to be snarling at her. I’m suss about his motives. I knew to be on the watch for Rhysand and at the beginning he has kind of Damon from Vampire Diaries vibes. Appears evil and is cunning.  It turns out that around 70% is when things heat up and the action takes place. In conclusion, I am glad I gave this book another chance.

R3EJ57U24SE02G,The writing is wonderful but the characters aren’t?,"I loved the writing style - the description of the scenery, the vagueness yet captivating description of characters that lets you create your own image but sticks to a base, and honestly the plot points are good. I cried at several points, mostly when the main chara was forced to realise what a dark life she was starting to live. The description of the sacrifices she made for her family at the beginning were extremely well built and I really enjoyed them. (Spoiler) I only object plot wise to the amount of money the family got given by main boi, felt like a cop out for what could’ve been a tragic family arc and felt like everything really just worked out too well for them… exception of Nesta who’s arc I didn’t expect and loved and cried for.  Now my main complaint. WHY DO ALL BOOKS FEEL THE NEED TO HAVE TWO LOVE INTERESTS??? I was so hooked on feyre and Tamlin, went through so much together and bared their hearts for each other and JUST…… god I would’ve given anything to see their story get a better light and become a really solid power couple but the minute she said ‘most handsome face she’s ever seen’ midway through the book introducing a DIFFERENT DUDE, I knew the jig was up. No way u call a dude most handsome and still stay with the beginning guy. Tragic. Truly, truly tragic. It’s not even that I object to her having another love interest - it’s that the main couple barely got a chance to really start loving each other in such a beautiful way outside of having to kill people to be together before the author introduces the new love interest (who, cough, does some NOT OKAY things to her aka lowkey sexually assaults her and TWISTS HER EXPOSED BONE TO MANIPULATE HER DECISIONS like bro.) and yeah I’m sure he redeems himself in the next book within 1 chapter. But… that was it for me. I was so, so here for feyre and tamlin - I cried for them from an hour in. But.. it just felt kinda cheap and random throwing another dude in while she’s LITERALLY FIGHTING FOR TAMS LIFE willing to die for him during amaranthas trials :(  I loved 90% of it - but the 10% has driven away any interest in reading book 2 (and thus rhys and feyres relo) - regardless of how beautifully written it is.",1526605392,"<span>I loved the writing style - the description of the scenery, the vagueness yet captivating description of characters that lets you create your own image but sticks to a base, and honestly the plot points are good.

But when Feyre takes the life of a fae she has to pay the price. Having to leave her father, her sisters and the life she has known behind, Feyre is taken beyond the wall and into a world where nothing is as it seems. What happens when the good versus evil is not what you thought it was and the fae you had been taught to fear were not necessarily the evil they had been made out to be.

R14LH2EW9QI4RA,"Good, not great!","I've had this book on my WTR list for some time and finally got around to doing so. And unfortunately, my thoughts are very mixed about this one. Firstly, there's been a lot of hype, so naturally I was expecting a blockbuster. Yes, this was a page turner but not because it was as unpredictable as some have reviewed. I felt like halfway through the book I knew who the villain was, so the thrill wasn't really there for me. The storyline was a little too ""unbelievable"" for me, and I think that's what put me off . It's a book about a married couple who project to the community that they're in a loving relationship; the husband Andy, a handsome and successful businessman and his wife Nina, a stay at home mum, who without her knowledge is the talk of the town amongst other well to do gossipers (ie. PTA mum's of the uber rich kind). Life becomes a little too overwhelming for Nina, so she decides to hire assistance in the form of Millie, an ex-convict on parole turned wannabe housemaid. Things become interesting when Millie discovers that this household isn't your average wealthy Long Island ""Mcmansion"", and within these walls lies a lot of drama and deceit. It was a very easy read, enjoyable and light, but lacked the plot twist and gripping suspense I was hoping for.

R2ISE15SLZUN72,Astonishing and mind blowing thriller,"Rating: 5 stars  This was my first introduction to Freida M and all I can say is I am obsessed!  In the housemaid we are introduced to the main character “Millie”. Millie is an ex-con who has recently lost her job and is now living in her car. So when she receives a call from Nina in regards to the housemaid position in a very wealthy neighborhood, she can’t believe it. Did this rich woman not do a background check on her?  Nina and Millie instantly click, a few weeks later Millie is her housemaid…  However, Millie feels as if something is not right in this house and something has to be wrong.

R31S3SAVDIPSKD,“tripe” - upgraded to “trash”,"For the first 50% I had a 5-letter review locked in: “Tripe”  I was almost shocked at the naive breathlessness of the diary-style jottings of a lusty Snow White fighting a wicked witch, flanked by two irresistibly chisel-jawed Adonises - one white and wealthy, one dark and earthy - both a coin flip away from her yearning loins.  But then the twist made me sit up and pay attention so I upgraded my 5-letters to “Trash”  And then I found myself sucked in - a bit like getting sucked in to the second half of a Charlie’s Angels episode just to see how Cheryl Ladd gets out of the burning cabin.

R3SSB0GYFQRVN2,The title is misleading.,"I think the book is wrongly named. It should be called “The lives and times of the people of Okinawa and a mix of other bits and pieces of philosophies”. I’m still confused about what this book is actually about. It definitely doesn’t provide much help to find YOUR Ikigai as the subtitles suggest, unless that goal is just to grow old. The short passages about the lives of the people in the village of Ogimi in Okinawa are lovely and do touch on the inhabitants sense of Ikigai.

It spends a lot of time describing the virtues of living a long life but then has snippets of various philosophies extolling the virtues of living in the here and now.

R3KD5DMPD7S3L,potpourri of longevity 101 - getting it all muddle-headed,"Leaning heavily on Dan Buettner’s Blue Zones, this book presents the 101 of longevity beyond Ikigai.

In short: this book has no direction, is imprecise on the science and would have been better if it had staid focussed on Ikigai.

R2S55MTFIZPJYI,Great Disappointment!,"My grandchildren and l were very excited when we found this item. They are huge fans of Lego so the chance to make moving robots hit the spot and a family date was set to build robots. Don’t know if the thumbs down should go to Klutz or Lego for false advertising but they need to seriously look at how this was marketed because our grandchildren were incredibly disappointed when they opened the box to find only enough Lego pieces to make one robot at a time and any thoughts of imagination games derived from having 4-8 robots to play with at one times went out the window. Seriously how cheap and thoughtless this was. How difficult would have been to add enough pieces to make at least four robots at a time or at least warn the buyer that extra pieces are needed. So dissatisfied with this experience even though quality of what we got was the usual excellent Lego product, the misleading information left a nasty taste in my mouth.",1338603450,"<span>My grandchildren and l were very excited when we found this item.
