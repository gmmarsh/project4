R3EA6MMOZN5N2J,"HOLY HANNAH. Easily one of the most spine-tingling, bone-chilling books I've ever read.","HOLY. FREAKING. HANNAH. Five stars and some fireworks for good measure. Hoover is a master at writing an evil antagonist and nailing character voice.  I hadn’t had the opportunity to read Verity until this past weekend when some Twitter friends and I agreed to read it together so we could talk about it after (and boy do I need to talk about this after!) This book was so dark and disturbing!  The first line was top-notch. Like… what an opener! It immediately draws you in and doesn’t let go. It puts you straight into the action and leaves your mind spinning, in this case after just fourteen words. Mind. Blown.  Verity is an example of a story within a story. The main character, Lowen, is an author—and don’t let that cliché fool you. This book was written astonishingly well. Lowen is hired as a co-writer to a hugely famous author, Verity Crawford, who is incapacitated and cannot finish out the remaining three of her six book deal. Lowen must get inside Verity’s head somehow so she can write the last three books as closely to her writing style and authorial voice as possible. To do that, she’s invited to stay at Verity’s house with her husband, Jeremy, and son, Crew, to go through her office and study her notes.  But Lowen finds a manuscript… an autobiography of sorts… and she learns much more about Verity than she ever thought she would—or wanted to. It’s a deeply personal and intimate account of big life events and the things that led up to them. And the more Lowen reads, the more she’s disturbed. And what’s more, she starts experiencing really creepy things around the house that make her question not only Verity’s sanity, but also her own. By the end of the story, I was blown away.  The twists at the end of this book are incredible!  By the time I was finished reading, my jaw was dropped, my eyes were bulging out of their sockets, and I just wanted to talk about it, but it was 2am! I now know what everyone else was talking about when they said this book is bone-chilling and dark. I highlighted so many lines that stuck out, and there’s one in particular in Verity’s biography that will stay with me (but I’m not going to tell you what it is!)  The character voice was strong, the line-level writing was superb, and I was thoroughly disquieted (and I mean that in the best possible way, because I love dark thrillers!)  The ending will have you questioning everything, and I absolutely love books that do that. Stories that make me think about them long after I’ve read the last word on the page.  I absolutely recommend this book to any fellow dark and disturbing thriller lovers. But be forewarned: when I say it’s disturbing… I mean it’s disturbing, especially as a mother. And as someone who lived with a sociopath for almost a decade, there are some eerily familiar feelings I experienced while reading.  Colleen Hoover is a new-to-me author, and I will not hesitate to read more of her books.",1538724731,"<span>HOLY. FREAKING. HANNAH. Five stars and some fireworks for good measure.

R2F6BQ0AU9Q6UF,"This was so messed up and disturbing, yet I couldn’t put the book down!","I’ve read quite a few of Colleen Hoover’s novels and been impressed by how emotionally intense her love stories are. So when I saw she wrote her first suspense thriller, I knew I was in for a quite a ride. The novel follows Lowen Asleigh, a struggling author, who’s in a dire financial state. She’s gotten an eviction notice for her apartment and doesn’t have a new manuscript to sell to publishers, having spend most of her time caring for her terminally ill mother. Then she gets an offer of a lifetime. Bestselling Verity Crawford has gotten badly injured in car accident and her husband, Jeremy Crawford, wants Lowen to finish her popular novel series. Desperate to keep a roof over her head, Lowen accepts. She comes over to the Crawford’s secluded house in Virginia to go through Verity’s notes and outlines for future novels. Instead, she stumbles upon Verity’s unfinished autobiography detailing disturbing thoughts and chilling admissions, including a confession of what really happened the day Verity and Jeremy’s daughter died. Should Lowen show the autobiography to Jeremy, who’s a devoted to his injured wife and oblivious to her true character? Or keep it to herself and not devastate an already grieving father and husband? I honestly didn’t know much more than that going into this novel and I feel like that really is the best way of experiencing it. Go into this blind and the reveals and admissions will horrify you. There were parts that difficult for me to read, that left me feeling sick to my stomach. And yet, I couldn’t stop reading out of morbid curiosity. I needed to know what will happen next. How will it end? And yes, the ending shocked me more than the whole book. It left me second guessing everything I thought knew leading up to it. And yet, it fits so well! My opinions on the characters changed from like to hate and hate to like by the time the novel ended. I won’t say who I liked and disliked for that will spoil it (and I will want readers going into this blind!). But I will say this, there are two points of views in this novel, Lowen’s and Verity’s, and they’re very distinct from each other. The pacing didn’t drag or feel rushed, it felt even, just perfect. Do yourself a favour and don’t read this at night like I did. I really regretted it because I was freaking out and unable to sleep.

R1E53YF0FXT3HD,Left me horrified but couldn’t put it down!,"Omg. I’m used to reading the romance novels Colleen usually writes so this was definitely different. Those confessions in the manuscript were bone chilling and had my heart racing with horror every time. These types of things to read or imagine are quite a trigger but the whole idea is to make you hate Verity Crawford and that’s exactly what happens with each chapter. How anyone could do what she “did” to her own child is absolutely anxiety inducing but the possibility at the end that it may have all been just the opposite of the truth gave a bit of relief in a way. Seriously, as a mother of 2, I can’t imagine the unbearable pain of losing one of my babies but to think that a mother could have actually resented them before they were even born is sickening. It’s appalling! But it’s an amazingly written book and sorry for the spoilers, but these comments are full of them so I figured it’s allowed. The amount of SEX is unreal but it helps build Verity’s character so I get it. I’m no prude so I won’t complain about it. It is what it is.

R2U8U6RVZO2NSP,"Very Important, But Shortsighted in its Overall Assessment of our Condition","This is an important book. It argues that smart phones (and other screens) have resulted in a troubled generation subject to mental illness. Instead of playing (preferably outdoors), children retreat into themselves and their social media, to their great detriment. This is argued at length and it is supported by extensive analysis, data, and first-rate social science research.  It is important that this book was written; there is general acceptance of the overall thesis already, but not the radical call to arms which the book represents, a call to arms from a prominent and trusted scholar.  Having said that, I must take issue with some of the principal points of the book. For example, he argues that helicopter parents are too risk-averse “in the physically safe environments that surround most children in developed nations today” (p. 70). Part of this point turns on his view that those who would sexually abuse or otherwise harm children are now operating on line; they are not prowling the streets of our neighborhoods. I think this is indefensible for a number of reasons. First, we can observe with our own eyes. Individuals are being pushed off of subway platforms onto train rails; whether these individuals are sexual abusers of children or not, they are on the subway platforms. In a number of our major cities we have seen “defund the police” actions, the redefinition of felonies to misdemeanors, cash-free bail, the tolerance of mentally-challenged homeless individuals and omnipresent property crime driven by drug addiction. We also have omnipresent pornography. This may defuse some individuals’ urgings but it might also suggest practices of which the consumer was previously unaware and, hence, awaken interest in those practices.  It is arguable that the “sexual revolution” was won, but that the losers in the struggle were women. They may now curse like sailors and be sexually promiscuous, but that does not necessarily represent a victory. Men now “fail to launch”; millions of able-bodied individuals have no interest in seeking employment; “toxic males” have been demonized; welfare protocols have encouraged single-parent families; marriage and family formation have been postponed; birth rates are down; STD’s are up; the concept of and the importance of the nuclear family are under assault. “Women’s liberation” has often come at the cost of children and abortion is the prominent election issue for one of our major political parties.  JH acknowledges some of these issues in passing, but he does not make them central elements of his etiology of anxiety in the way that he does smart phones. This may be because of his age; he simply takes these things for granted rather than seeing them as conscious public choices. I am a generation older than JH (by 22 years). I remember being in a “smoke shop” in Norwood, Ohio buying candy when the proprietor showed a potential consumer some ‘pornographic’ pictures. My friends and I gawked in astonishment. The pictures (we assumed they had to be French) were of semi-clad individuals tossing beach balls to one another. A mile down the street from the smoke shop was a public swimming pool; one day, sitting in the boys’ locker room, I heard older (probably 15-16 year-olds) discussing the effects of marijuana. I was astounded, since I assumed that marijuana was something that was only consumed by jazz musicians in big cities. Fifty years later I read student papers (in my creative nonfiction class) that discussed designer drugs in greater detail than one might expect in a true crime television series. When I was in college in 1959 I was urged by my prefects and rector to attend a lecture on pornography in South Bend. This was eye-opening (in many respects) since it brought to my consciousness a medley of practices and kinks of which I was totally unaware. I should note that my adolescence had not been “sheltered”; I worked construction from ages 15-16 and saw men fighting with hammers and heard (nearly each week) the exploits of one electrician who spent each weekend on “motel dates”.  China does not have drug dealers; they execute them. I point that out to reinforce the point that societies make conscious choices. One does not put chewing gum under tables in Singapore. When I first visited the United Kingdom in 1973 there was a prominent story in the London papers of vandals spraying graffiti on trains. The young offenders were required to clean the trains and their families were fined 500 pounds, a considerable sum at that time. I am not recommending that we execute drug dealers or order 20 lashes for misdemeanors, but we are currently losing 100,000 individuals (often children) to fentanyl each year, and while we see some hand-wringing we do not see the actions that could be taken to reduce its presence in our society.  In the late 90’s I was interviewed by a local radio station concerning a book I had just published on my adolescence. The interviewer would have been from JH’s generation; his first question was a wistful one about the grand old days when children could freely and safely play outside (something JH now advocates as a central part of his program). I responded that it was wonderful; we had adventures every day in the woods that adjoined the park at the bottom of our street, but I added that he should remember that we were safe in part because we were heavily armed. We had large knives, hatchets and B.B. guns. More important, we knew that if we were confronted by a child abuser we would be able to utilize those weapons with no concern whatsoever that the law would see things from the abuser’s point of view. A corollary: if there was any evidence of such abuse in our neighborhood our fathers might mete out street justice, knowing that the law would be on our side. Now, increasingly, the law favors the criminals over the victims. The point is that the generally safe environments in developed countries of which JH writes are not all that safe and the likelihood of justice for the victim has been reduced over the years as a matter of public policy. A few years ago two drug addicts broke into the home of an elderly couple in our neighborhood. The man shot one (who survived) and killed the other. The universal public response was that ‘he was lucky that he did that in Missouri’. On the other hand, a woman a few streets away was followed home and murdered after a drug addict saw her using an ATM machine. This was in an upper middle class, putatively safe neighborhood.  I love the idea of kids being able to play outside and take some risks and I fully support JH’s advocacy for the replacement of screen time with free play time, but I believe that the etiology of our current condition has resulted, in part, from what is usually termed the “coarsening of our society” and that that coarsening is in large measure the result of conscious changes in public policies and mores that could be altered. That coarsening affects children in particular and one can understand why they might wish to retreat to their bedrooms and enter an artificial world rather than the one that they currently are forced to inhabit.",0593655036,"<span>This is an important book.

I point that out to reinforce the point that societies make conscious choices. One does not put chewing gum under tables in Singapore. When I first visited the United Kingdom in 1973 there was a prominent story in the London papers of vandals spraying graffiti on trains. The young offenders were required to clean the trains and their families were fined 500 pounds, a considerable sum at that time. I am not recommending that we execute drug dealers or order 20 lashes for misdemeanors, but we are currently losing 100,000 individuals (often children) to fentanyl each year, and while we see some hand-wringing we do not see the actions that could be taken to reduce its presence in our society.<br><br>In the late 90’s I was interviewed by a local radio station concerning a book I had just published on my adolescence. The interviewer would have been from JH’s generation; his first question was a wistful one about the grand old days when children could freely and safely play outside (something JH now advocates as a central part of his program). I responded that it was wonderful; we had adventures every day in the woods that adjoined the park at the bottom of our street, but I added that he should remember that we were safe in part because we were heavily armed. We had large knives, hatchets and B.B. guns. More important, we knew that if we were confronted by a child abuser we would be able to utilize those weapons with no concern whatsoever that the law would see things from the abuser’s point of view. A corollary: if there was any evidence of such abuse in our neighborhood our fathers might mete out street justice, knowing that the law would be on our side. Now, increasingly, the law favors the criminals over the victims. The point is that the generally safe environments in developed countries of which JH writes are not all that safe and the likelihood of justice for the victim has been reduced over the years as a matter of public policy. A few years ago two drug addicts broke into the home of an elderly couple in our neighborhood. The man shot one (who survived) and killed the other. The universal public response was that ‘he was lucky that he did that in Missouri’. On the other hand, a woman a few streets away was followed home and murdered after a drug addict saw her using an ATM machine. This was in an upper middle class, putatively safe neighborhood.<br><br>I love the idea of kids being able to play outside and take some risks and I fully support JH’s advocacy for the replacement of screen time with free play time, but I believe that the etiology of our current condition has resulted, in part, from what is usually termed the “coarsening of our society” and that that coarsening is in large measure the result of conscious changes in public policies and mores that could be altered. That coarsening affects children in particular and one can understand why they might wish to retreat to their bedrooms and enter an artificial world rather than the one that they currently are forced to inhabit.</span>",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2U8U6RVZO2NSP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0593655036,4,False,True,us,False,3,1,"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2024",2024-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,Richard B.

R1ARR06670F89D,Jonathan Haidt's The Anxious Generation Sparks Urgent Reflection and Action,"Jonathan Haidt's The Anxious Generation is, simply put, one of the most important and vital works of nonfiction I've read, and—quite possibly—the most influential book on my wife and I's parenting style and approach to technology.  The Anxious Generation is bombshell after bombshell detonating all of our preconceived assumptions about social media, Gen Z, parenting, ""safetyism,"" mobile phones, childhood, education, and mental health. You've probably long suspected some of Haidt's observations and conclusions, but to see them put to words—and backed by heaps and heaps of research, neuroscience, philosophy, and spiritual musings—is to have your assumptions about what we consider ""normal"" rocked to its very core.  I'm so thankful I read this book prior to the birth of my daughter. This is a book I want to put into the hands of every parent, want-to-be parent, teacher, politician, tech CEO, or anyone who works/engages with children and/or cares about the collective mental health of our country. I firmly believe that if enough people—especially parents of young children—read this book, it could change the trajectory of our nation's approach to technology and childhood.  In short, Haidt's argument boils down to one salient point: We've overprotected our children from the real world, and underprotected them from the virtual world.. He advocates for a return to the ""play-based childhood,"" and points the transition to the ""phone-based childhood"" as the primary driver of a significant increase in anxiety, depression, and self-harm among teenagers—especially teenage girls. Additionally, because of culture's perpetual fear-based approach to child-rearing, we've left our kids woefully unprepared for the pressures of the ""real world""—and points to evidence of the startling number of Gen Zers and younger Millennials who appears trapped in a state of perpetual young adulthood.  The best aspect of The Anxious Generation is how easy it would've been for Haidt to just document a series of social ills and offer a diagnosis. But the back half of this book is full of extremely practical steps, application points, and ""rules"" for ensuring your children don't have their neurobiology hacked by tech companies who only want to monopolize their attention—mental health consequences be damned. And, even though the harms hone in on Gen Z and younger Millennials, I find myself often convicted of my own habitual phone use throughout the course of this book and I realize even I didn't escape unscathed.  Read this book. Buy a hard copy and highlight it. I want to give a copy to all of my friends, young parents, and teachers. And not just because I want to discuss this book—but, because as Haidt points out over and over again, this is a cultural issue that requires mass collective action in order to change.

R3LPI8LSYWY8SM,Save the kids from the curse of smartphones,"Something is ailing in the generation who lived through adolescence in the second decade of the twenty-first century. Jonathan Haidt produces a series of graphs to show that they are suffering from a sudden and dramatic increase in levels of anxiety and depression. Two big questions arise from this. One is why? The other is what can be done about it? Haidt’s answer to the first question is that smartphones and social media are to blame. The sudden and dramatic rise in the incidence of mental illness among the young, occurred between 2010 and 2015 immediately following the introduction of smartphones. Correlation, of course, is not the same as causation and there might have been other things in play, international and economic crises for instance. Haidt, however, presents a convincing argument that smartphones and social media are the real culprits and explains how they have, effectively, hijacked the normal development of childhood and adolescence with serious consequences for mental health. Haidt summarises his answer to the second question in four points. No smartphones before high school, no social media before the age of 16, no phones in schools and, finally, more unsupervised play and childhood independence. Although the book has lots of data and graphs, it is written in plain English and structured in a way to make the point easy to follow for the non-specialist reader. Each chapter ends with a summary of the main points covered. And while it is criticising the harm that new technology can do, it also demonstrates the real benefits of technology through an accompanying website in which Haidt and his collaborators are constantly updating and engaging in further discussions on the topic. For example, it contains a collaborative review of all the arguments that something other than smartphones are behind the epidemic of mental illness.",0593655036,"<span>Something is ailing in the generation who lived through adolescence in the second decade of the twenty-first century.

R34IHY1FY0K1YJ,Serious Questions and Difficult Solutions,"Social scientist Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation articulates details of a new psychological/social malady swiftly metastasizing in our culture. Wickedly, it begins in childhood, with the consent and abetting of adults. Smartphones, and other digital devices, “bring so many interesting experiences to children and adolescents that they cause a serious problem. They reduce interest in all non-screen-based forms of experience (author’s italics)”. This is the fundamental understanding at the core of the author’s thesis. Throughout The Anxious Generation, Haidt attempts to ask and answer in detail the following questions of the toxic cultural change we are living through: What has happened? How do we know it has happened? Why has it happened? What can we do about it?  Haidt writes: “I’ll show what governments, tech companies, schools and parents can do to reverse the disastrous transition from play-based to phone-based childhood.” He gives us a banquet of food for thought, but the elephant in the room remains: are citizens hungry for what he serves?  The book asserts that childhood’s necessary learning experiences have been curtailed by a cultural confluence of toxic events: safetyism that has moved from exclusive emphasis on physical safety to include now fears regarding emotional safety (safe rooms in colleges). Documented diminished confidence in faith-based and civil institutions also contributes to more disassociated adult human interaction.  “On the internet, everyone is the same age, which is no particular age. This the main reason why a phone-based adolescence is badly mismatched with the needs of adolescents…It all got worse during the COVID years of ‘social distancing’ and online everything.” According to studies reported by Haidt, “45% of teens report that they use the internet ‘almost constantly’…[This] has enormous implications for cognition.”  In 2017, Israeli psychologist, Professor Sam Vaknin, characterized the hording or paucity of hits on social media “like” buttons as a conditioning process, comparing it to the electrodes implanted in a rat’s brain to deliver a pleasure-jolt of dopamine. This conditions the rat to choose the pleasure bar instead of the food bar, and the rat will begin to starve itself. Vaknin, citing eating disorders and suicide statistics among teenagers, especially girls, stated that giving up addiction to social media is a two-step process that requires first, deprograming, and second, withdrawal. What has evolved is, en-masse, a serious mental condition, in kind with brainwashing.  Haidt offers potential solutions to the early, deleterious pre-teen exposure to smartphone dysphoria: 1. No smartphones before high school. 2.No social media before 16. 3. Phone-free schools. 4. Far more unsupervised play and childhood independence. The Anxious Generation says these goals probably might be effective. But will enough parents collectively agree to them? There is no current answer to that question.  Haidt writes: “The Great Rewiring of Childhood pulled young people out of real-world communities, including their own families, and created a new kind of childhood lived in multiple, rapidly shifting networks. One inevitable result was anomie, or normlessness, because stable and binding moralities cannot form when everything is in flux…The phone-based life produces spiritual degradation, not just in adolescents, but in all of us…In 2010 there was little sign of a mental health crisis.

Most parents (and teachers) know that things have gone awry with phones in kids' hands all the time instead of interacting with peers, parents, and anyone around them, and the author showed how things took a turn for the worse when smart phones and social media took over our kid's attention, and their play-based life diminished.  Haidt discusses two trends happening right now: overprotection in the real world and under-protection in the virtual world, which is leading to an anxious generation of those born after 1995. Girls are particularly experiencing more mental health problems of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, and social media is largely to blame. He also discusses boys, but I have girls and so read that part more closely.  The author suggests four foundational reforms:  1. No smart phones before high school 2. No social media before 16 3. Phone-free schools 4. Far more unsupervised play and childhood independence  The bottom line is that kids need to get off their devices and regain control of their minds.

R394LR4EU43BWN,Another home run! Sans evolution,"The media could not be loaded. I absolutely love Jonathan Haidt and pre-ordered this book because I couldn't wait to read and devour like I did the Coddling.  The research is spot on, the message is critically important (though I would say, I don't know that this message is limited to teens. I think Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism book is in order for adults too. The 24 hr news cycle is making us anxious too!) I digress. I love what he has to say about raising children and I have implemented a lot of these ideas with my four children already (disclaimer: Safety Minimalism gets the cops called on you for just letting your children play outside - at least near the suburbs of NYC where I live - but the confidence is a worthy trade off).  The only problem is evolution can't support these claims or sustain them. Evolution is a western-centric limited worldview that can only be described as a process of chaos and chance that has no particular purpose or meaning guiding it. In one of the photos of my review I addressed this when Haidt refers to hunter-gatherers to explain how important play is. The issue is that if evolution is ""guiding"" us, we can just evolve and adjust again to respond to the deathly threat of the digital revolution. There is no objective, absolute standard that says we must go back to our primitive ways, in fact- for whatever reason ""evolution"" got rid of play-based childhood and going back could be considered retrograde. Unless people were made with some purpose and design, we have no reason to go on this mission to save childhood. It will be selected out just like all other traits (how do we assume in evolution which traits are the good and which are the bad btw?). Evolution is a worldview that brings about change through death. We can't put all the digital issues of the age back in the box unless we are bold enough to claim that there is an objective standard of truth and morality.  Chapter 8 offers a view that some level of spirituality can ""save us."" I agree in a sense, but it can't be empty and made up or promulgated as an opiate of the people. God is not to be taken so lightly as our bandaid cure. We can have all of the excellent ideas of this book, without using the made up excuse that we are just mechanical processes to suppress the truth that we were created and designed by God to be saved from our sins only through Jesus' payment for them in his death and the promise of His resurrection. Lots of the world believes this, which is why I say evolution is very western hegemonic and atheistic in its nature to give us a good excuse to getting out of accountability from God.  All that said, I still really love this book and think it is very urgent and should be extended to all adults. But if we really are an unguided, mechanistic bunch of atoms bumping into one another, it really doesn't matter at all that the kids are not alright. They'll adjust. They'll ""evolve.""

R2UG2Q1B5F3PFO,The Most Societally Important Book of the Year,"Jon Haidt is a brilliant NYU Stern social psychologist who is relentless in his scientific pursuit of the truth. The ""Anxious Generation"" is a must-read for every parent, educator, administrator and politician, because it documents the enormous and quantifiable ""negative externalities"" spawned by social media usage. The trends documented are especially deleterious for teenage girls. Haidt marshals evidence of depression, anxiety, self-harm and even suicide and concludes: ""Social media use does not just correlate with mental illness; it causes it.""  An apt analogy to smoking is drawn, given social media apps are - by design - addicting and marketed to minors. Modern societal norms don't allow pre-teens to buy tobacco, alcohol or enter casinos so why are we allowing them access to ""digital fentanyl""? Unfortunately, in a world of ""move fast and break things"" techno-optimism, what has been broken is teenage mental health. Haidt correctly assesses that this is a collective action problem and offers four foundation recommendations:  1) More unsupervised play and childhood independence; 2) No smartphones before high school; 3) No social media before 16; 4) Phone free schools;  Regulatory frameworks and societal norms often lag Silicon Valley's bleeding-edge speed of development, but the damage being wrought here - and painstakingly documented by Haidt - is becoming visible enough that this book could catalyze real, positive and lasting change. Gift a copy to anyone with younger children or local educators - spread the word and help solve the collective action problem.  Final note: All of Haidt's books are highly recommended, it is just an unfortunate reflection on our current state of affairs that the arc of his publishing gamut runs chronologically from Happiness to Anxiety instead of the reverse order.",0593655036,"<span>Jon Haidt is a brilliant NYU Stern social psychologist who is relentless in his scientific pursuit of the truth.

My colleagues who teach older ages have described an increase as well so it is obviously not an isolated observation.  When I read the urging a few days ago to read this book from a respected leader in the pedagogy I follow to read, I reviewed the information on it.

R2O2ODOSY2X4I1,"convincing, a little dull, not a lot of plausible solutions","I thought the book made a convincing case, but Haidt was preaching to the choir when it came to this reader, since I'm one of the few remaining middle-class American adults under 60 who doesn't use a cell phone at all.

R14FIRR29VD94N,One Chapter needs a little more information,"Dr. Mary Claire has really helped me understand my perimenopause symptoms and helped me to be an advocate for myself. One chapter needs a little more information on it is the recommendation on getting a calcium score test done. Patients need to know that Calcium test or CAC isn't a desirable test because it doesn't show soft plaque. Soft plaque is what causes stenosis of the coronary arteries and is only seen on a CTA. If I have high cholesterol and high LDLs and go and get a CAC, test, and it comes back zero that doesn't mean I am not a risk for coronary artery disease. For example, if I go on Lipitor, a statin drug, and my calcium score is zero and I go back and get a CAC in a couple of months of being on Lipitor, your calcium score of zero will go up! My doctor told me that statin drugs are raising people's CAC scores! When his patients see this they can't understand why this is happening. Statin drugs harden the soft plaque. Soft plaque, the plaque that is more thrombogenic, is hardened from statin drugs and now is calcified plaque. Thus, bringing up your calcium score. I highly recommend a CTA and not a CAC. CTA will show soft plaque and where it is. The location of the soft plaque, too is very important. My own mom had a very high CAC score because she was on Lipitor for years.

As a retired warfighter I can attest to the truths he exposes-about the deliberate dismantling of all that once assured each American that they were protected from threats not just outside our borders, but the insidious threats that have been grown and deliberately placed in all the areas we once deem sacred. Hegseth writes in such a way, that no one reading his book can walk away from it and ask-“why didn’t anyone warn us”. This is a must read for every American concerned about the direction our country is going. Why? Because unless you have a strong, well disciplined, patriotic military protecting your home-you’ll have no homeland to protect. Every standard that once ensured the fitness of military recruits to serve-physical, mental, psychological, chemical(as in not having a hx of illegal drug use), criminal, moral has either been eliminated, greatly reduced, or at the very list been something that can be waived-in order to put them in uniform. Leaders trying to maintain order and discipline with the ranks of those they lead, honor the oath they have sworn to are punished by their own leaders-as happened to Major Hegseth.

Hegseth writes in such a way, that no one reading his book can walk away from it and ask-“why didn’t anyone warn us”. This is a must read for every American concerned about the direction our country is going. Why? Because unless you have a strong, well disciplined, patriotic military protecting your home-you’ll have no homeland to protect. Every standard that once ensured the fitness of military recruits to serve-physical, mental, psychological, chemical(as in not having a hx of illegal drug use), criminal, moral has either been eliminated, greatly reduced, or at the very list been something that can be waived-in order to put them in uniform. Leaders trying to maintain order and discipline with the ranks of those they lead, honor the oath they have sworn to are punished by their own leaders-as happened to Major Hegseth.<br>So if you really want to know the key factors that are destroying our military, and oh by the way your security as an American-Hegseth’s book should be read and digested.</span>",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2W57P738HMHHP?ASIN=0063389428,5,False,True,us,False,1,1,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024",2024-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,MAJ L Haines,https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6FZOOUY5HSGWP32H5542UNUHVA,AH6FZOOUY5HSGWP32H5542UNUHVA,,27.0,,

I skip around the book and we review skills she has already mastered and there are also new concepts that she has begun to work on. Someone also made a comment about the directions and children not being able to read them, I thought about that as well but that where WE come in as the guardians, they should be working on materials with supervision; not only for directions read but also for praise and positive reinforcement. I purchased other books to work with her over the summer as well, and sure she finishes few pages a day in This book, but what I most appreciate is the engagement and how the book is broken up into sections, math skills, science project suggestions, letter sounds and sight words, patterns and scientific concepts and is very colorful. I say get the book. IT is worth it. You want learning to be fun so kids want to continue working.

The story flows while nailing the characters without over descriptive character development. There is enough Latin and ecclesiastical terms to be relevant to the churched - not enough to be a stumbling block for others. There is an abundance of story based on well observed humanity. Richard Coles knows his county - the English Civil War boundaries do still stand 400+ years later!

But more corrosive was the shame of previous generations born out of marriage and wartime secrets. Woven in, seamlessly, are themes of past sins revealing themselves, offence and murder, how the smaller losses of the present may rekindle heartbreaking losses of the past, justice and mercy, forgiveness and coming to a shared peace after such turmoil. Fr Daniel’s formidable mother, actor brother and growing friendship with the Detective Sergeant form a solid based for the Rector’s crime solving observations. Great holiday reading.

RWPEPXNPRD9NV,Plodding murder mystery,"Stories about sleuthing clerics are nothing new, Father Brown being perhaps the best known. But one written by an actual Church of England vicar – albeit one who is a former Communard and a regular on radio and TV panel shows – is a bit different.  Canon Daniel Clements wants to bring the parish of Champton St Mary up to date by installing a toilet at the back of the church. Members of the congregation, in particular the powerful Flower Guild, are opposed. Perhaps an unlikely background to murder but still…  The story plays out in a sort of timeless Middle England, although the cultural references place it firmly in the 1980s. Champton may not be St Mary Mead but there’s more than a hint of Miss Marple here in the depiction of the undercurrents and rivalries of village life.  The writing is quite good with some nice descriptive passages but the pace is doggedly pedestrian. You’re about a third of the way in before anyone gets killed and even as you approach the denouement it continues at a steady plod. There are a lot of rather two-dimensional characters many of whom don’t bring much, if anything, to the plot. In fact Daniel’s dogs are more fully rounded than some of the human players. It doesn’t really work well as a whodunnit either as there are few hints at the identity of the killer.  I was looking forward to reading this but I have to say it left me rather disappointed. It’s hard to escape the conclusion that if it didn’t have a celebrity name attached it might have struggled to find a publisher.",1474612644,"<span>Stories about sleuthing clerics are nothing new, Father Brown being perhaps the best known.

R3P5G6NZUR85U1,Cosy crime in need of a caffe ristretto,"As I love crime novels – Ann Cleeves, Peter Lovesey, Anthony Horowitz, Elly Griffiths - I really wanted to like this, but it was disappointing.  There’s plenty of expert advice online for a budding author wanting to know how to get published in crime fiction, such as, “be clear about the time period, and don’t overwhelm your readers with too many characters in the early chapters.” Oops. Here, the decade in which the plot unfolds is unclear from the get go, which is disconcerting. And so many villagers are thrown at you at the beginning that the book only becomes a page turner when you start flicking backwards to find out who they all are. When the first murder took place, I couldn’t immediately place who the victim was. The murder itself was an event so long coming that in the meantime I began to come up with alternative titles for the book. Then there’s the problem with the main protagonist - Canon Clement. Proactive he is not. Two thirds of the way through, his mother comments on how good at detecting he is when, to my mind, he hasn’t done any.  Now I really like the Reverend Richard Coles and he has a winning writing style, but his publisher has done him a disservice by not being strict enough in the editing. If this manuscript had arrived anonymously in the slush pile, would it have got this far this quickly? For a first-time fiction author, the potential is there, so why wasn’t there more input to make this, the Reverend Coles’ first book, the best it could be? I’m merely a reader but I can see the flaws, so what blinded the publishers to them? Could it be they rushed everything through hoping for instant success on the back of Richard Osman’s excellent Thursday Club series? Well, it worked in a way because this book is a best seller. What it isn’t is a page turner.  If Weidenfield and Nicolson want a successful series, they’d better get a grip, otherwise, they’ll leave themselves open to the charge that the obvious answer to the budding author’s question of how to get published in crime fiction, is “First become a celebrity.”",1474612644,"<span>As I love crime novels – Ann Cleeves, Peter Lovesey, Anthony Horowitz, Elly Griffiths - I really wanted to like this, but it was disappointing.<br><br>There’s plenty of expert advice online for a budding author wanting to know how to get published in crime fiction, such as, “be clear about the time period, and don’t overwhelm your readers with too many characters in the early chapters.” Oops.

R1YGXH0A0EQHEZ,Mesmerising Adult Fairy Tale - Terrific,"Welcome to the Court of Adult Fairy Tales, with 5 stars for the latest instalment from the breath-taking series written by Sarah Maas (The Court of Thorns and Roses). And now the Court of Wings and Ruin transports us yet again into this adult fairy tale world and on journey of danger and triumph that is action packed and alluring, and where wisdom, betrayal, loyalty, and love, feature heavily in the story.  Another spell binding story from an author whose imagination appears limitless, a story that is told with a vast range of intriguing characters, a plot that is superb in its concept and delivery and with a level of suspense that will rival the best thrillers. Absorbing, captivating, and compulsive as we remain entrapped in Maas's world of High Fae and the Court of Thorns and Roses.  The Plot  Think, plan, believe, be ready. Organise, prepare, trust and be on guard.  And yet they were not ready, and the Night Court, including Rhys and Feyre, had not foreseen the alliances that were being forged around them and Tamlin is making deals with the invading king of Hybern threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. However, close to the ‘Wall’, the southern territories and the human lands are most at risk from the Hybern onslaught. Yet the wall came down and the Night Court was left defending its court. The enemy used the element of surprise to their advantage and even with the combined physical and mental skills of the Night Court inner circle, victory seemed the stuff of dreams.  There is so much happening in every chapter it is difficult to summarise all the sub plots, twists, and storylines. Suffice to say the seven courts are in play and we are moving towards the major battle, where fittest and most courageous will get to write the ending. A difficult feat because no one Lord can achieve this on their own, but it is difficult to know where loyalties lie.  Review and Comments  Wings and Ruin, brought so many conflicts yet it is an epic love story, much of the earth was scorched and weary from battle yet the story and setting continues to be enchanting, the characters are scheming but deliciously flawed and likeable and the writing is just stunning where I have to conclude that not a word could be written differently.  That said, I cannot lavish enough praise on this series, it is truly awesome and one I would have enjoyed before embracing Fantasy more readily.

R3CH5CR9RKD6ZE,4 Stars - Great Third Installment,"So, in my reviews for ACOTAR and ACOMAF I mentioned how a book should give you the feels – it should influence you emotionally if it’s doing its job properly; well, this one had tears streaming down my face for the entire last 10%. There were happy tears and sad tears and the entire damn thing took over my consciousness for the 10 days or so over which I consumed it.  It’s a young adult fantasy novel but unlike YA’s like Fangirl I feel like, because of the more diverse subject matter, as an adult it’s so easy to get immersed in the story – particularly as it takes place within a completely new world. The novel explores issues on a personal level and even goes so far as to introduce younger readers to really tactical approaches to war and conflict. Maas draws inspiration from all over, the Oroboros springing out of Egyptian mythology and other references popping up throughout (the Myrmidons from the siege of Troy, remodelling the ancient Greek ‘Illyrians’ and other references from the bible, Greek mythology and Russian folktale.) This weaving together of fantasy and history adds richness to the text and is part of the reason I found the second and third books so much more interesting to read. #NerdAlert – sorry, not sorry. And, actually, the way Maas wove plot elements from the first and second books into the key events of this third instalment was fabulous in itself. The plot was definitely interesting enough (and full of enough twists and turns) to keep me hooked from chapter one until the very last page.  I found myself highlighting so many passages out of sheer love of what was written (don’t worry I was reading using kindle so I didn’t deface any books!), I really enjoyed Maas’ writing, more so than I did in the first and second books. Plot wise, ACOMAF still remains my favourite because the whole Feyre- Rhysand escapade was just perfect and I totally shipped them in book one (sorry Tamlin!) They just made so much sense and the way they respected each other and even went so far as to make each other better really stood out as a winning trait for an already likeable and bad-ass pairing.  “the male who had always presented me with a choice not as a gift, but as my own gods-given right.” I didn’t find their relationship as compelling in this third book however. The whole mating thing is something I’m a bit conflicted about. I mean, on one hand it’s totally sweet and it’s like their souls are connected and whatever and it makes for interesting writing (where there’s a mating bond but someone doesn’t want to accept it) but I don’t know. It kind of just belittled the idea of ‘love’ and really reminded me of the imprinting thing in Twilight. Feels like it’s going that way too: Feyre’s going to get pregnant with a crazy, super-strong, night court baby and Azriel’s going to imprint *cough, sorry* have a mating bond with it or something. Whilst it’d be cute to see Rhysand all cute and protective I just don’t wholly like it – the mating thing is something I can’t decide if i like or not.  But that’s not the only reason their relationship is less rivetting: there was no “will they, won’t they” so much of their interaction was a bit dull (except that tense scene near the end – omg). The sex scenes in particular were a little unnecessary and awkward and I’m definitely glad there were less than in the second book. (They often felt a bit over-written – like, they had sex, I get it, she doesn’t need to be shining like a beacon or making the mountain tremble. I mean really, *eyeroll*. But then, this book wasn’t as much ‘about’ them – it was about saving the world which *I GUESS* is kind of important too… I still love them though. On a complete tangent I actually still like Tamlin (not for Feyre, obviously) and think he’s a complex and interesting character to read about – he’s flawed like anyone else but ultimately shows his true colours in this, the third book .  The third book really doesn’t disappoint – whilst much of the ‘action’ happens in the last 10% of the book every focal character had a difficulty they were facing and their own issues to contend with along with the main plot and this made them far, far more interesting than they may otherwise have been. And Maas deals with PTSD well – she does not pretend that the hardships faced by her characters does not affect them but also reminds us that it does not make them weak – an important message. I adore every member of the night court not only for their love of one-another but for the sheer selflessness they all exude. It promotes such a healthy message (though I wont deny a little selfishness from someone might’ve made the characters a bit more diverse and believable.) Actually, there were mistakes made by night court members but it was mostly just Feyre who made mistakes and had regrets. A lot of her choices in the first 10% of the novel were definitely up for contention but I think ultimately, they reflect (and are a result of) her suffering in the previous two books and the plot simply builds her character and extends those emotions beyond just telling us how she feels. But, that’s the night court for you – secret guardians of peace in Prythian (with a handful of misbehaviour and more than a sprinkle of sass).  They weren’t the only court I liked though! Learning about the other courts was great fun and made me just want to get out the pencils and paints and try my hand at some fan art. The series does really have a great way of inviting fandom (as well as both bad and good discussion) – it’s a series readers want to talk about with other people, to write fanfiction on and to continue experiencing in every way possible – and that really is a testament to Maas’ ability to generate characters we care about. Even characters who were ugly, mythical and somewhat disturbing became lovable in this novel. I cared about the Suriel, learned to understand The Bone Carver and became attached to a creature so terrifying and gruesome it even sent Cassian screaming in fear. Maas frequently takes our expectations of characters and flips them on their heads and it’s really well done throughout the ACOWAR.  A lot of readers don’t like the series, or Maas’ writing and I definitely understand that – I definitely could have swung that way after reading the first book. There are definitely a few things that annoy me about her writing and the way she does things – I haven’t read the Throne of Glass series because I haven’t managed to get through the first book yet. Maas, like most writers, has flaws but For me, this was a good story and I really connected with the characters – it let me forget the things I didn’t like so much. But if you experienced the series differently and hated it I want to hear about it too. This book is such a topic of discussion for many readers and it’s good to talk about the different issues it deals with. I really did not like Everything, Everything by Nicola Yoon but lots of people loved it so I definitely know what it’s like the be on the opposing side of a fandom – reading is such an individual experience, it’s important to have your own response; your opinions are personal to you.  Overall, I really enjoyed this series and look forward to hearing more about the Court of Dreams characters in the future. The events at the end of this book temporarily broke me for the 20 minutes or so during which I inhaled the words! Ultimately, if you’re a fan of Maas and liked the second book, I can’t see why you wouldn’t like this one.",152661717X,"<span>So, in my reviews for ACOTAR and ACOMAF I mentioned how a book should give you the feels – it should influence you emotionally if it’s doing its job properly; well, this one had tears streaming down my face for the entire last 10%. There were happy tears and sad tears and the entire damn thing took over my consciousness for the 10 days or so over which I consumed it.<br><br>It’s a young adult fantasy novel but unlike YA’s like Fangirl I feel like, because of the more diverse subject matter, as an adult it’s so easy to get immersed in the story – particularly as it takes place within a completely new world. The novel explores issues on a personal level and even goes so far as to introduce younger readers to really tactical approaches to war and conflict. Maas draws inspiration from all over, the Oroboros springing out of Egyptian mythology and other references popping up throughout (the Myrmidons from the siege of Troy, remodelling the ancient Greek ‘Illyrians’ and other references from the bible, Greek mythology and Russian folktale.) This weaving together of fantasy and history adds richness to the text and is part of the reason I found the second and third books so much more interesting to read. #NerdAlert – sorry, not sorry. And, actually, the way Maas wove plot elements from the first and second books into the key events of this third instalment was fabulous in itself. The plot was definitely interesting enough (and full of enough twists and turns) to keep me hooked from chapter one until the very last page.<br><br>I found myself highlighting so many passages out of sheer love of what was written (don’t worry I was reading using kindle so I didn’t deface any books!), I really enjoyed Maas’ writing, more so than I did in the first and second books. Plot wise, ACOMAF still remains my favourite because the whole Feyre- Rhysand escapade was just perfect and I totally shipped them in book one (sorry Tamlin!) They just made so much sense and the way they respected each other and even went so far as to make each other better really stood out as a winning trait for an already likeable and bad-ass pairing.<br><br>“the male who had always presented me with a choice not as a gift, but as my own gods-given right.”<br>I didn’t find their relationship as compelling in this third book however. The whole mating thing is something I’m a bit conflicted about. I mean, on one hand it’s totally sweet and it’s like their souls are connected and whatever and it makes for interesting writing (where there’s a mating bond but someone doesn’t want to accept it) but I don’t know. It kind of just belittled the idea of ‘love’ and really reminded me of the imprinting thing in Twilight. Feels like it’s going that way too: Feyre’s going to get pregnant with a crazy, super-strong, night court baby and Azriel’s going to imprint *cough, sorry* have a mating bond with it or something. Whilst it’d be cute to see Rhysand all cute and protective I just don’t wholly like it – the mating thing is something I can’t decide if i like or not.<br><br>But that’s not the only reason their relationship is less rivetting: there was no “will they, won’t they” so much of their interaction was a bit dull (except that tense scene near the end – omg). The sex scenes in particular were a little unnecessary and awkward and I’m definitely glad there were less than in the second book. (They often felt a bit over-written – like, they had sex, I get it, she doesn’t need to be shining like a beacon or making the mountain tremble. I mean really, *eyeroll*. But then, this book wasn’t as much ‘about’ them – it was about saving the world which *I GUESS* is kind of important too… I still love them though. On a complete tangent I actually still like Tamlin (not for Feyre, obviously) and think he’s a complex and interesting character to read about – he’s flawed like anyone else but ultimately shows his true colours in this, the third book .<br><br>The third book really doesn’t disappoint – whilst much of the ‘action’ happens in the last 10% of the book every focal character had a difficulty they were facing and their own issues to contend with along with the main plot and this made them far, far more interesting than they may otherwise have been. And Maas deals with PTSD well – she does not pretend that the hardships faced by her characters does not affect them but also reminds us that it does not make them weak – an important message. I adore every member of the night court not only for their love of one-another but for the sheer selflessness they all exude. It promotes such a healthy message (though I wont deny a little selfishness from someone might’ve made the characters a bit more diverse and believable.) Actually, there were mistakes made by night court members but it was mostly just Feyre who made mistakes and had regrets. A lot of her choices in the first 10% of the novel were definitely up for contention but I think ultimately, they reflect (and are a result of) her suffering in the previous two books and the plot simply builds her character and extends those emotions beyond just telling us how she feels. But, that’s the night court for you – secret guardians of peace in Prythian (with a handful of misbehaviour and more than a sprinkle of sass).<br><br>They weren’t the only court I liked though! Learning about the other courts was great fun and made me just want to get out the pencils and paints and try my hand at some fan art. The series does really have a great way of inviting fandom (as well as both bad and good discussion) – it’s a series readers want to talk about with other people, to write fanfiction on and to continue experiencing in every way possible – and that really is a testament to Maas’ ability to generate characters we care about.

This is the best book out of all 5 for sure, unpopular opinion considering that people usually favour ACOMAF. However, the action in ACOWAR is incredibly exciting, the war itself, the twists, the relationships created with the Suriel, the Bone Carver, Bryaxis and The Weaver. The meeting of all the High Lords was one of my favourite chapters, especially meeting Helion! The inner circle of the Night Court are great characters that I never get tired of, especially Amren, whose dark edge reminds me of myself. The bond between Feyre and Rhysand continues to be electric, and with the twist near the end this book had me sobbing, can’t remember the last time I cried over a book.

R1S895Q8ZMWOQ3,"Speechless, just incredible.","Wow. Just, wow. I was speechless when I finished the book. It was honestly incredible. I really thoroughly enjoyed this one; I may even like it more than A Court of Mist and Fury!  The reason I think I enjoyed it every slightly more than A Court of Mist and Fury is because I felt like the story just kicked in from the first page and didn’t stop until the last. I was sucked into the story from the very beginning; I took me a few chapters to really get into ACOMAF (for some reason 🤷‍♀️).  So. Freaking. Much. Happens. Feyre and Rhys’ reunion may possibly be among my favourite scenes from any book. It was everything and I loved it. I love their relationship so damn much. The whole book was such a rollercoaster; I think I went through every emotion possible.  Being a massive fan of the Lord of the Rings book series, I love battle/war scenes. In fact, the war scenes reminded me a little of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields from Return of the King. There’s just something about the action and excitement of a battle or war scene. This was one aspect of the book that I really loved; I think it was really well written and was very exciting. I just wanted to keep reading and not put it down for even one second.  The further development of characters was really, really great. I especially loved that we learned more about Mor; she’s a really great character and one of my favourites. I also liked the development of Nesta and Elaine; I found them both a little annoying when they were first introduced to the story again but found myself loving them both by the end. I can’t wait to see where their characters go in the next books.  I cannot wait to read the next two (although, I’m gutted that there are only two left).",152661717X,"<span>Wow. Just, wow.

R8ZELZW4Y5UPL,A Beautiful Way To Tie Up This Arc Of The Story,"’And it was the heart of a dreamer that had ceased beating inside that monstrous chest.’  Before I start this review I just want to admit that I’m writing this review up after also finishing the final two books in the series so my thoughts aren’t as fresh in my mind as usual. Consequently I apologise if I’m not as detailed as usual within this review.  It’s no secret that I’m a fan of all things fae and if you’ve seen any of my reviews for the ’Throne Of Glass’ series then you’ll know that I adored that too. So it’s not exactly surprising to say that I adored this book on the whole; although it does pain me to admit that I simultaneously found myself wishing for slightly more.  If I hadn’t read the ’Throne Of Glass’ books before picking this series up then maybe I’d feel differently. Maybe I’d have adored this series as much as I did that one. Yet there were times throughout this novel where I couldn’t help but draw parallels to events, characters or concepts from that series. I suppose it’s not necessarily a bad thing, as I adored them within the books, yet I do think that it personally stopped certain elements from impacting me as deeply as they should.  By this point in time it pretty much goes without saying that I adored the world and characters that Sarah J Maas created within this series. Everyone is fascinating to learn about, there’s mountains of history to uncover (all of her worlds make me long for stories centred within different eras) and the danger and intrigue is non-stop throughout. The writing, as always, left me spellbound and Feyre truly shown in her new role at the beginning of this book.  The end of the novel tied events up beautifully – in a satisfying manner – and left me curious to discover exactly how the author planned to return to the world. Obviously it’s a setting with the potential for countless stories but it still gave you a sense of things being finalized within certain aspects of the previous storylines.  Personally I can’t help but wonder if this book would have benefitted from a couple of more points of view. Its set within a vast and complex fantasy world and I truly do think that learning more about certain areas of that world could have added to the impact of the plot. Naturally some viewpoints would carry the risk of bringing certain spoilers to light but I can’t help but wish that there was some sort of perspective included from within the Spring Court. If you’ve read the previous two books in the series then you’ll know how greatly Tamlin seems to change and I really long for more insight into that. Perhaps not from his perspective but from someone, at least. Similarly I can’t help but feel that including a viewpoint somehow linked to the human queens could have added to the book. Their motivations and realms feel rather unexplored presently.  Other than that I can’t help but feel like certain major powers were destroyed too swiftly (although I did appreciate the unexpected twist of one of those particular takedowns). And the placement of the sex scenes felt a little unnecessary on occasion (being too exhausted to climb into a bath but being up for amorous activities instead for instance).  On the whole I thoroughly enjoyed this book however and thought it tied the initial arc of the series up beautifully. If you’ve enjoyed the previous instalments within the series then I’m sure that you’ll similarly get swept away once again. With a little more insight and additional perspectives I truly believe that this would have been a five star read for me.",152661717X,"<span>’And it was the heart of a dreamer that had ceased beating inside that monstrous chest.’<br><br>Before I start this review I just want to admit that I’m writing this review up after also finishing the final two books in the series so my thoughts aren’t as fresh in my mind as usual.

With a little more insight and additional perspectives I truly believe that this would have been a five star read for me.</span>",https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R8ZELZW4Y5UPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=152661717X,4,False,True,gb,False,9,1,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2024,2024-01-21T00:00:00.000Z,Charlotte Watkins,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHOJHB4R2BMXHCOV6S6N53Q2F7HA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AHOJHB4R2BMXHCOV6S6N53Q2F7HA,,,,
R2BFRAI5AAX82Y,4.25 stars,4.25 stars 2.5 spice Right ok. So going into this book I was told that it was long and kinda dull and yes it was long but it was so incredible. I didn't know how to do this review because I didn't... But I'm going to split it up onto the sections of the book so full spoilers ahead. Part 1 The boring part with Tamlin however very cute parts with Rhys and Feyre talking down the bond other than that I didn't care. However looking back I think I should of cares more because the characters in the first part were re-mentioned in the final part and I was very confused. Part 2 The best part. With the first bit with Feyre and Lucien going back to the night court and the fight in the winter court. Them after chapter 14 when the mates are reunited I pretty much sobbed my way through because of how sweet they are. Now at this point I was like mmmh 4.5 stars??? But no. One quick note before I go onto the final part is about the spice in this book. I have heard so many things about the spice in this series so lemme give you a breakdown. Yes it is spicy but not that spicy around 2 chapters in this book had full on spicy scenes along with maybe 4 more little pieces of spice throughout. Part 3 The actual battles. I would say after the big high lord meeting up until the end of the war is probably the most boring part of this book my brain wasn't taking in the information so I literally can't tell you anything other than the suriel dying and her going back to the bone carver and Tamlin saving her from thw Kings Place. Literally all I can remember at this point I was like ok this is now a 4 stars. Then the final ending went and my jaw dropped and I started crying. She did not just try and kill Rhys that's not allowed. It's fine though he's ok now. Then the final meeting with the high lords is what made this book a 4.25 stars. Overall this book is better than the first one but not as good as the second one purely because the ending of the second one is unbeatable.,152661717X,<span>4.25 stars 2.5 spice Right ok.

R2G141IH6EVIHP,A disappointing end to the trilogy,"Continuing on from A Court of Mist and Fury, the story starts with Feyre back in the Spring Court as she acts as a secret spy in Tamlin's kingdom ahead of the coming war with Hybern. Yet if Prythian is to stand any true chance against Hybern, Feyre, Rhysand and the other members of the Night Court are going to have to find ways to gather all the allies they can get. Will all the High Lords be able to find a way to work together, and set aside their differences?  I really enjoyed the first two books of this series and was eager to read this last instalment, however, I have to say I was disappointed in this end to the trilogy and found it coming up pretty short in comparison to its predecessors. For a start the book was unnecessary long, and overall I found it quite a slog to get through, tempted at times to simply give up, and I have to confess that I ended up more skim reading certain parts.  I was intrigued with the set up at the start of the story back in the Spring Court, and think this could have been made to work really well, but in actual fact this first part of the book was pretty poor for me. A lot of this was due to Feyre constantly being portrayed with such super-powers, nothing really felt like a threat or challenge to her, as she just walked over everyone so easily. Also I know Tamlin did act badly in the second book, however, there were reasons as to why he did what he did, and I for one don't think he deserved the complete lack of mercy that Feyre treated him with here.  Indeed, I have to say that overall I didn't really like Feyre's character all that much in this book as a whole. She seemed to have lost all her vulnerabilities, and was just a bit too ruthless and arrogant for me. Its not that she's lost her compassion entirely, but she's very self-absorbed here.  I did enjoy Lucien's character in this book, indeed it may have been my overall favourite portrayal in the book, and that was because unlike so many other characters, Lucien still had his complexities (unfortunately I felt he was under-used in the second half of the story). Other favourites on the other hand, such as most of the Night Court, just were painted a little too immaturely in this book. On the one hand there is this really serious threat portrayed of the impending war, and yet so often these characters are just goofing around and making jokes, acting rather like teenagers if anything, with more interest in their romantic entanglements than anything else. Nor did these romantic sub-plots really lead anywhere though, with no character or relationship development.  Feyre and Rhysand were just too 'sickeningly' in love in this book, Rhysand himself 'too perfect', all the mystery and edge that was so present in the first book and was still maintained in the second despite understanding his character better, lost entirely now and replaced instead by a 'puppyish' character who was just bland and boring in this book (oh and once again we keep being told he is the most powerful high Lord in history, but not once did I get a display of that power). Other aspects felt forced, such as Mor's bisexuality.  Nesta and Elain I thought fared better in this book, with their new cauldron-gifted powers, and there is some interest into what their own stories might hold in future books, however, right now after this book, I'm unsure if I would take a chance and continue with the next proposed trilogy centring on Nesta.  Some of the lesser used characters, particularly those older creatures such as the Bone Carver and the Weaver, did intrigue me, but I just felt there was too much going on in this book, with a lot of convoluted storytelling and sub-plots, and ultimately these characters could have been used better than they were. A lot of the story was strategy centred ahead of the war, with too many new characters introduced and not enough time to really get to know them, like the other High Lords. Even once we got to the war itself it didn't hold my interest as it should have.  Maas continues to tell rather than show a lot of the time, with lots of exposition when it comes to characters' backstories, and whilst in previous books such flaws could be overlooked, here everything just felt too messy for it to work. Oh and the constant use of the word 'mate' in this book was just cringey.  This was just an over-bloated and unengaging book, with none of the character-driven storytelling of the previous two books, such that it ruined what had till now been an enjoyable series and I lost interest in many of the characters I had hitherto really liked. I've given it a 3 stars, but in all honesty it may be a 2.5 stars.",152661717X,"<span>Continuing on from A Court of Mist and Fury, the story starts with Feyre back in the Spring Court as she acts as a secret spy in Tamlin's kingdom ahead of the coming war with Hybern.

Oh and the constant use of the word 'mate' in this book was just cringey.<br><br>This was just an over-bloated and unengaging book, with none of the character-driven storytelling of the previous two books, such that it ruined what had till now been an enjoyable series and I lost interest in many of the characters I had hitherto really liked. I've given it a 3 stars, but in all honesty it may be a 2.5 stars.</span>",https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R2G141IH6EVIHP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=152661717X,3,False,True,gb,False,4,3,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2020,2020-11-21T00:00:00.000Z,little bookworm,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGQOSFTKUQONWQEGGMSRLFGLUBRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AGQOSFTKUQONWQEGGMSRLFGLUBRA,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/a792ae9f-5340-4a55-834b-6a0ef0834311._CR0,0,90,90_UX110_.jpg",10.0,,
RZJDDL5583F85,“Leave This World A Better Place Than How You Found It”.,"At first I found this book a little harder to get into, but then Azriel lured me in with all that dark and brooding shadow stuff and I was so hooked. I think it's probably fair to say that the first part of this book is perhaps a little lost. Feyre, as you might remember, has switched sides (but is faking it, obviously because Tamlin...no thanks!), and is in the home of the enemy. That's the Spring Court to you and me. But instead of there being lots of treachery and clever deception from Feyre, she's out of there in no time; a shame because I love some cloak and dagger to keep me interested. But never-mind, because after this it's one hell of a ride and so that missed opportunity was of little consequence.  This third book introduces all the players in the War. Not only has Feyre got to convince a host of High Lords to help her defeat Hybern's Army (which is HUGE!), but she's also got to somehow cover up that little thing about taking a bit of each of their powers for herself to make her some sort of super badass High Lady. Bit tricky. Oh and then there's the small issue of how she's just duped Tamlin and now kind of needs his army too. Terribly sticky situation for Feyre, but absolutely wonderful for us readers - so many new characters, each with excellent back stories (because we all know Maas is a Queen of a good back story woven in), and a particularly creepy Bone Carver and other vicious beasties she might want to get on side. I feel exhausted for them to be perfectly honest but it was delicious!  The characters really come to life in this book with even more complexity than ever before. Whilst I still feel that Mist and Fury really excelled at challenging traditional characters, breaking the mould and generally being a massive improvement on Feyre's badassery, I think this book makes the slightly more secondary characters more exciting. Cassian, Azriel, Mor, Amren, Nesta and Elain get much bigger parts in this story and I really fell in love with each of them rather than just being wrapped up in Feyre and Rhys' situation. I think Maas is really excellent at making you become entirely invested in characters, even those who might seem quite detached from the initial story-line. It makes for such rich world building and I absolutely love it. I can't think of another group of characters in a book who have felt quite so real to me.  This is a bit of a slow burner compared to the previous two books, and given that it's largely focused on finding High Lords and Armies, I think that's probably why. But when the War truly begins, wow - that's fastest my eyes have ever moved across a page! The writing is utterly unstoppable; I felt like I was watching it all happen. It's that bum on the edge of your seat kind of good where you just can't predict which curve-ball is coming at you next. Equally, there are some darker elements which are so exciting and genuinely a little bit chilling. I think this element of Maas' stories is often underrated because her characters are so addictive and often take centre stage, but it was a real tension builder in this book - not to be read in a dark, shadow-filled room though.  I still struggle a little with the romance elements. Not the building of a romance; I think Maas is brilliant at leaving me wanting more in terms of waiting to see what's going to happen between characters. Particularly after Feyre having such a swift change of heart with Tamlin - you just never know what's going to happen and who she'll turn you against! But now that Feyre and Rhys are mated, the sexual tension has kind of fizzled out (despite there being lots of sex) and the sexy scenes for me are really awkward. I think it's the choice of words she sometimes uses like being ""claimed"" or ""branded"" that just destroy it for me. It's really obtuse and a bit too yuck for me. But anyway, Cassian saves the day on the romance front - what a heart-throb. Gone are the days when Rhys was my future book boyfriend - Cassian and Azriel are like some sort of heroic Godly duo aren't they?  Definitely a nice finish to the first three books, with lots of elements wrapped up and plenty more still to come. I can't wait for the next one.  Alas, Amren still gives me the heebyjeebies!

R2K6I5BU6DE4VV,Sarah J. Maas has once again created a masterpiece!,"Sarah J. Maas has once again created a masterpiece, as always her writing was wonderful to read. The way she is able to build such a vivid and beautiful world is amazing and I was gripped from the first line. At the end of A Court of Mist and Fury we leave Feyre back at the Spring Court and in the heart of enemy territory. I have being looking forward to see Feyre play spy for so long and was so happy to find that it definitely lived up to all of my expectations. I adored that we got to see a lot more of Lucian and I feel like we really got to know his character better. I loved the intense moments between him and Feyre when they don't know whether to trust each other or not, they are just perfection. I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be funny but I really found it hilarious, at one point I just could not stop laughing everyone in my house literally though I was going crazy. Maas really created some epic moments that are just incredibly well done, that I will never forget.  “Night Triumphant - and the Stars Eternal. If he was the sweet, terrifying darkness, I was the glittering light that only his shadows could make clear.”  Now lets get to Rhysand...erm.. what can I even say? OH YES!! HE WAS AMAZING! I loved every single Rhys moment that we got to see and I just love him as a character and even though I didn't think that his character could be developed any more after reading ACOMAF, the way Maas wrote his development blew me away it was phenomenal. Now to all my other favourites, all I'm going to say is I adore them all especially Cassian and Azriel. Again it was pure perfection. Mor and Amren's character development also really went somewhere in this book, I never expected what happens to happen and I am still surprised and amazed at the great things that Sarah J. Maas did.  The plot was so action packed and there was always something happening it was so stressful but in a really really great way, I am so glad that we got to see loads more of the High Lords, that was brilliants and I loved the meeting, I am running out of words to use to describe how amazing things were.  I only had one tiny problem, I really wanted a discussion to happen between Tamlin and Feyre near the end after you know what (No spoilers here, see I am really trying), I just really needed more. Saying that I think that things were left in a great way and I really felt satisfied with the conclusion, and I also think that the way it ended really did justice to this amazing series. I am happy with Feyre and Rhysand's ending but I really hope that we get to see them again even if its just a cameo. They will always be some of my favourite characters of all time.  “It's a rare person to face who they are and not run from it - not be broken by it.”  I definitely ugly cried and I will never get over it. I will go as far to say that part of me died while reading this book. The feels were ridiculous and I have never ever cried like I did when I cried while I read this. I'm not sure where the series is going to go and which characters we will see again but I don't care I will read anything Sarah J. Maas writes and the fact that there is going to be more from this world is enough for me. But honestly do I have to wait another year, what will I do until then.  “I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have... the wait was worth it.”  Overall I loved it and I'm not sure whether A Court of Mist and Fury is still my favourite or whether this one is but I loved them both, and this series has ruined me I have a feeling that I will never find anything as good as these, I am getting depressed just thinking about it. The only thing left to say is that I highly recommend this series, everyone should read it and I think that even if you don't enjoy the fantasy genre I would be extremely surprised if you didn't like this.  5/5 Stars!

R2WQMHJAHEE0CD,ACOWAR,"As this is one of my favourite series I pre-ordered this on Kindle and as soon as midnight rolled around I devoured this book. I think I finished it within a day. By far my most anticipated book of 2017.  ***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***  The story picks up pretty much right where we left off in ACOMAF with Feyre back in the Spring Court and ready to destroy Tamlin. I definitely hyped up this book too much after reading ACOMAF, this one was still really good, but book 2 just blew my mind and I felt this one was missing...something.  Things I loved: -Nesta and Cassian. To be honest I wasn't taken with them in book 2 but this book sealed the deal for me. I really didn't get along with Nesta in book 2 but I loved her to bits in this one. She tells it like it is and doesn't care what anyone thinks. I also thought it was very fitting for her to be the reason for the king's downfall. -All the new character introductions in this book, my favourites being Helion, Kallias and Viviana. -Phenomenal world building and I loved visiting all the courts and how amazing each and every one was. -Loved the revelation about Lucien's metal eye (really reminded me of mad eye moody from Harry Potter) also really liked the twist with Lucien's father being Helion! Can't wait to see what happens there. -My favourite scene was when all the high lords gather for a meeting at the Dawn court. Absolutely brilliant.  Things I didn't really like: -Besides from Rhys, Lucien is by far my favourite character. He was my favourite in ACOTAR and I didn't lose hope for his redemption. However, I felt like he was a bit cheated in this book. He appears in the first half and then isn't seen until the last chapter. With the discovery that Elain is Lucien's mate at the end of book 2 I thought Maas would explore that relationship in this book but they only shared a few sentences between them the whole book so I was sort of confused as the why that even occurred at the end of book 2, but I may be missing the point and hopefully the next book will clear everything up...I hope.  -I know Elain went through hell in ACOMAF, however, she was hardly in this book and when she was she was utterly broken, like an empty shell and I was constantly waiting for everyone to try and help her on her recovery but nothing really happened. I loved Elain in the previous books because she was kind, loving and sweet but something big was missing for her character in this book. Also as it turned out she was a Seer nothing really came of that either, all she did was find the Suriel.  -Another thing which really did not make any sense was the fact that Feyre had the power from all the courts and I felt like she was on the sidelines for most of this book, which was disappointing.  -Mor, I felt like Mor deserved a bit more than what she was given in this book. The revelation that Mor is a Lesbian was, in my opinion, not handled properly. I am gutted as it felt like Maas just threw it in just because all the backlash she was getting. I hope Mor gets her own book and she is finally happy.  -Lastly, I thought at the end with their father was a bit rushed. We have hardly even seen him throughout this series and all he said was 1 sentence before he was done in. I wanted to see him, Elain, Feyre and Nesta reconnect etc.  The thing that made me cry like a baby: The Suriel. I will cry every time. This also really reminded me of Harry Potter with Dobby's death, I have no idea why!  Overall a great conclusion with enough loose ends to continue on with the series (which I can't wait for) Amazing world building, characters and general storyline.

Absolutely brilliant.<br><br>Things I didn't really like:<br>-Besides from Rhys, Lucien is by far my favourite character. He was my favourite in ACOTAR and I didn't lose hope for his redemption. However, I felt like he was a bit cheated in this book. He appears in the first half and then isn't seen until the last chapter. With the discovery that Elain is Lucien's mate at the end of book 2 I thought Maas would explore that relationship in this book but they only shared a few sentences between them the whole book so I was sort of confused as the why that even occurred at the end of book 2, but I may be missing the point and hopefully the next book will clear everything up...I hope.<br><br>-I know Elain went through hell in ACOMAF, however, she was hardly in this book and when she was she was utterly broken, like an empty shell and I was constantly waiting for everyone to try and help her on her recovery but nothing really happened. I loved Elain in the previous books because she was kind, loving and sweet but something big was missing for her character in this book. Also as it turned out she was a Seer nothing really came of that either, all she did was find the Suriel.<br><br>-Another thing which really did not make any sense was the fact that Feyre had the power from all the courts and I felt like she was on the sidelines for most of this book, which was disappointing.<br><br>-Mor, I felt like Mor deserved a bit more than what she was given in this book. The revelation that Mor is a Lesbian was, in my opinion, not handled properly. I am gutted as it felt like Maas just threw it in just because all the backlash she was getting. I hope Mor gets her own book and she is finally happy.<br><br>-Lastly, I thought at the end with their father was a bit rushed. We have hardly even seen him throughout this series and all he said was 1 sentence before he was done in. I wanted to see him, Elain, Feyre and Nesta reconnect etc.<br><br>The thing that made me cry like a baby: The Suriel. I will cry every time. This also really reminded me of Harry Potter with Dobby's death, I have no idea why!<br><br>Overall a great conclusion with enough loose ends to continue on with the series (which I can't wait for)<br>Amazing world building, characters and general storyline. I will definitely be picking up more Sarah J Maas.</span>",https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/R2WQMHJAHEE0CD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=152661717X,4,False,True,gb,False,3,4,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 February 2018,2018-02-21T00:00:00.000Z,bookish_heights,https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZG2DTQCPFRW4I72RBCW6G2TQMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AHZG2DTQCPFRW4I72RBCW6G2TQMA,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/6166a8c8-83d3-4b1a-94a0-b781d9d74ea8._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg",,,
R3VPBQGKJYY5ZM,Infinite stars for this incredible story.,"What an incredible journey I have been on. This trilogy has been phenomenal. I am absolutely gutted to have completed reading all three books and whilst I know there are more books in this series, I cannot imagine this particular story being topped in all honesty. I must say a huge thank you to my good friend for the recommendation - I would have missed out reading something very special if it hadn’t been for her.  This story will always have a special place in my heart. I thought the author wrote this complex and detailed narrative perfectly. There has been so much throughout that has amazed me – all the small details especially. I always enjoy a story that has twists and turns, and I’m in awe how the author penned so many incredible scenes, taking the story in a different direction or progressing it brilliantly… each and every time.  Reading ACOTAR has been incredible from start to finish. All the emotions I've experienced have been fabulous. This journey has been one huge emotional roller coaster ride and I’ve loved every moment (yes, even those heartbreaking scenes). I’ve changed my opinions about characters when I never would have thought it possible, and at times I’ve questioned loyalties. I have laughed, cried, loved and despised. You’ll need to strap yourself in for all the angst - that’s a certainty!!! The characters that I have got to know and come to love are all incredible. I’m certain that we all have our individual favourites but I feel that they all played an important and integral part in the story, and they did so very well indeed.  A Court of Wings and Ruin has got to be my favourite book out of the three. Every chapter was packed with new developments and there are a lot of chapters! I was a bit daunted by the size of this novel in the beginning if I’m honest, but this book is a real page turner and I never took notice of where I was at until I those final few chapters, which was only because I didn’t want my journey to end. It was a struggle to put my kindle down when real life needed my attention.  I don’t often reread books. I think we all have ‘to be read’ lists as long as the River Nile. However, I will be reading this trilogy again – that is for certain. I have a feeling I’ll discover little details that I missed first time round, and I cannot wait to be reminded of my favourite scenes – and there are quite a number of them!  I highly recommend that you read the A Court of Thorns and Roses series. If I could give this series infinite stars I would. This story will quite literally take your breath away and I must admit I’m rather jealous of those reading this for the very first time. I need to repeat that I found this to be a phenomenal story, and I can’t imagine you not enjoying it as much as I have.",152661717X,"<span>What an incredible journey I have been on.

R1YUD2CWYDO78J,"Inconsistent, bloated, and just a bit amateurish really.","Despite genuinely liking some parts of this book, I can't give it any higher than three stars because there was SO MUCH wrong with it. Maas has, in previous books (ToG 1 through 3 and ACOTAR being examples), shown herself to be an accomplished writer and storyteller and I'm disappointed that her books seem to be getting worse, not better. They're also getting longer (i.e. bloated and bogged down with material that any other author would NOT get away with in traditional publishing) and released more frequently, so perhaps this accounts for the decline in quality? As I said, there were parts that I liked, and a good story buried under the weight of too many unnecessary side plots, side characters, unsexy sex scenes (sorry, Sarah, but your sex scenes are FAR from erotic, and what are they doing in a book marketed as children's/teen fiction anyway?*) and repetitive narrative embellishments. Seriously - there was SO MUCH repetition in this book that at times the writing felt quite amateurish. Also, stilted, run-on sentences, overuse of ellipses, and questions written without question marks. Where was her editor?  There are going to be more books in the ACO series so I guess that's why so many threads were left open-ended. But the ending concluded very little, and it felt rushed and unsatisfying because of that. The end of a book is NOT the place to introduce several new characters and plot threads, even if they will come up in future books. And this is to say nothing of the poor handling that certain characters and situations got! I'm with parts of the fandom/critical readers of Maas's books in agreeing that there are some VERY problematic aspects to ACOWAR and its predecessors, to do with LGBTQIA representation and stereotyping, race and ""feminism"". This series gets lauded for its supposedly feminist characters, but the feminism here is surface-level only - start probing the characters' actions, their justifications for certain actions, and the fae society as a whole, and you'll see some big, ugly holes in Maas's worldbuilding and writing. For me, the book falls far short of true feminism.  Now that I've torn into ACOWAR with the parts I disliked, here's what redeemed it to a three star rating.  Prythian, the world it exists in, and the fae courts are great. I loved seeing more of the courts, and the meeting between the inner circle and the other High Lords was one of my favourite parts of the book. I want more of this world - just with more consistent worldbuilding. And some rules about how, exactly, being high fae works (ageing despite supposedly being immortal? Do they all die eventually? What? How?!) The non-high fae creatures were SO interesting. The Death Gods, the Firebird, the Peregryns, the Winter Court creatures - more, please, just less shoehorned in. I liked the dynamic between Cassian and Nesta. I liked Elain's development through the novel. And I liked that Tamlin earns a bit of redemption by the end. Feyre and Rhysand were sort-of interesting when they were interacting with other characters, but for the most part, their interactions together bored me. There was no real conflict in their relationship, and while I'm not a fan of pairing couples up and then having them fight just to inject drama into a narrative, every relationship, however perfect, has its ups and downs. Maas could have made it just a *little* harder for Feyre and Rhysand (especially given the newness of their relationship in a world where so much heavy, awful stuff is going down) without tearing her ship apart - and then some of those sex scenes might have actually felt earned, rather than just being more gratuitous examples of how perfect and special and magical their bond is. (*eyeroll*/*barf*) Likewise, the endless, *endless* ways in which other characters (Lucien, the denizens of Velaris, all the inner circle members at certain points) were written to feel like satellites orbiting and worshipping the Feysand sun REALLY annoyed me. Enough, I know they're perfect, and I know everyone is aware they're perfect - ENOUGH!!!  So yes, I struggled with this book. The pacing felt woefully uneven, and there was just too much wrong with it to make it really enjoyable and satisfying. At times I just couldn't face picking it up. But I finished it, and found parts of it fun. But that's all. I want to love Maas's books - but the last four (QoS, ACOMAF, EoS and now ACOWAR) have left me disappointed.  *About sex scenes in teen books - I don't think sex should be deliberately left out of teen books. But I really don't like the way Maas handles them. They are written fairly graphically (bordering on erotica), there are usually too many of them IMO, and her treatment of sexuality is not consistent or thought through enough to make the representation in these books feel appropriate for a teen audience.

R2ID60ELFDEALW,Lisa has not lost her touch!,"I often read the 2 or 3 star reviews before I buy a book, on the basis that there are too many good books waiting out there to waste time on bad ones; and having several of Lisa Jewell's books before and enjoyed them, I'll admit I was a a bit unsure about this one based on comments like 'this is not as good as her other books,' and, worse, 'she's lost her touch,' which of course can happen to writers - but I can promise you it has not happened here. This is as good as anything Ms Jewell has written before, and I'd say one of her best. 'None of This Is True' is as fast, complex and as clever as can be, and actually made me gasp out loud at a stunningly audacious 'really did not see this coming' moment early on. At first it all seems pretty par for the course - Alix is character you're not going to feel much sympathy for, with her seemingly perfect and privileged lifestyle, and Josie is the one with the hard knocks and the dead ends...and yes, while'none of this is true,' but it's not a straightforward truth-for-lies swap at all, and isn't what you might expect at all. The plots twists are just superb. In terms of a reading experience, it's all there - the usual Jewell sharp eye for detail, the nailed-it descriptions and the keen ear for dialogue, all there in spades, so very skilful, and never grates; but on top of that, the plot is clever, elegant, and my gawd, is it pacey!

RNZ695B1PB6ZL,"A must read, dark psychological thriller! 🩸","'When she doesn't like the reality of things, she finds a reality she prefers.'  This is the story of Alix Summer and Josie Fair, two women both celebrating turning 45 at the same pub. In the pub toilets, they first meet and discover they are 'birthday twin's - born on the same day. Not only that, born in the same year at the same hospital. Soon, both of their lives become intertwined and nothing will ever be the same again.  I read this book at the beginning of last week and have delayed reviewing it until now, as I just couldn't find the words to describe how much I love it! It is a dark psychological thriller, full of suspense, that only gets darker the more you read- and at certain points I would say revolting. The inclusion of podcast transcripts, social media as well as the documentary aspect all add another dimension to the story. I was gripped and on edge, uncomfortable from the beginning until the end.  It is amazing to have two female protagonists at the forefront of this story, with a particular spotlight on how social media is not an accurate reflection of someone's life and nobody knows the reality of life behind closed doors. Josie is particularly complex and unhinged. She is very odd, narsasistic, obsessive and manipulative. She really is quite terrifying! Everything she does is calculated and whilst being very unlikeable, I was totally captivated by her and I can't stop thinking about her. I loved Alix. She is a woman who wants to have it all - the career, house, marriage and family. While there where times I wanted to shake her, for her to stand her ground - in relation to both Josey and Nathan, ultimately I found her very relatable. Her love for her family and wanting to protect them, shone through everything.  This is a tale about the fragility of life and how things are never as they seem.

R3T63AG375XHLT,Anther great read from Jewel,"Jewel never disappoints and she certainly delivers here in this brilliant holiday read, full of twists and turns that have you guessing throughout.-It's a plot of obsession, lies and murder. Alix and Josie meet by chance at a pub where they are celebrating their forty fifth birthdays. From the outside one has it all, friends, looks and fame: she produces successful podcasts while the other is full with bitterness, regrets and what could have been. After their initial introduction in the pub loos, Josie initiates another meeting whereby she offers to be the next subject on the podcast. An opportunity Alix jumps at despite her initial doubts about this rather strange woman. Josie excitingly informs her that something big is going to happen to her but first she must tell her side of her story. She begins to detail a toxic life of grooming, child abuse and domestic violence. As Alix falls deeper into her web of lies and deceit she puts her husband and family at risk and danger. Soon it is Josie calling the shots and Alix who is following blindly always one step behind. Unfortunately she realises too late just how dangerous and manipulative Josie is. Jewel's style and structure for this novel is interesting as it flips back and forth between narrative and interviews, which will contribute to a Netflix documentary series. As it progresses it captures the unraveling of Josie. highly recommend",1804940208,"<span>Jewel never disappoints and she certainly delivers here in this brilliant holiday read, full of twists and turns that have you guessing throughout.-It's a plot of obsession, lies and murder.<br>Alix and Josie meet by chance at a pub where they are celebrating their forty fifth birthdays.

They will pretend to be besotted with each other. Romance readers will know exactly where this plot is headed. The central romance is a moving emotional voyage, and there are many funny moments thanks to the entertaining Bridgerton family.<br><br>It's a good book. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could as it didn't fully realise the potential of its enthralling beginning.</span>",https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/customer-reviews/R365F46BSL09VX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0063078902,5,False,True,au,False,7,1,Reviewed in Australia on 14 January 2016,2016-01-14T00:00:00.000Z,lisa,https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEH3AUZHC373KQEF4ZNWMFBHHUSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,AEH3AUZHC373KQEF4ZNWMFBHHUSA,"https://images-fe.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/d4d9cfaf-b1af-43bd-9f6d-f3b780993289._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg",3.0,,
R123MUK6HKAQ2Y,Sucked into the Bridgerton vortex,I felt like I was one of the few romance readers on Earth who hadn't read or watched Bridgerton and after much contemplation I decided that I would read the series and then watch the first season on Netflix. And I have to say that I am very glad I did. I fell in love with the Bridgerton clan and I'm so excited to read more books and see the remaining seven siblings get their HEAs. I did like Simon and Daphne's story and I could feel the chemistry between the two from very early on. There is one scene - which is well written about in reviews and articles so I won't bother rehashing it here - that is very unpleasant to read in the books (and unfortunately is not rectified in the TV show either) but as I was prepared it existed I was able to reconcile my distaste for what occurred and move on (which I know isn't something everyone can do). This scene is really the reason it's 3.5 stars for me (otherwise it would've been a 4/4.5) but it is what it is. I'd still recommend reading giving this book a go... especially as the later books look fantastic!!  3.5 stars,0063078902,<span>I felt like I was one of the few romance readers on Earth who hadn't read or watched Bridgerton and after much contemplation I decided that I would read the series and then watch the first season on Netflix.

R18V8L7NU718GV,Brilliant book,"I put off reading this book for ages, it was in my house on the TBR pile but we all know that the TBR pile is like a big black hole!!! As soon as It Starts With Us was announced though, I preordered that and decided to wait and read them together. I am so happy with that decision and I can tell you that I devoured this in a day and was so happy that I could immediately start on It Starts With Us.  This story actually touched so close to home, I grew up in an abusive home and all I can say is that it wasn’t pretty, unlike this story though, my monster was my mother, the one person that should be protecting us. (Absolutely not looking for sympathy I’m just sharing that I can understand the fear that this book portrayed)  With that said though, I absolutely loved this book, there were so many moments that just broke my heart while I read it, but equally there were so many moments that filled me with so much love, joy and hope.  This following quote sent chills through my body.  My mother went through it, I went through it I’ll be damned if I let my daughter go through it. I kiss her on the forehead and make her a promise. It stops here, with me and you, It ends with us!!!  I have been there and had to make that same choice for the exact same reason, someone needs to break the cycle of abuse.  Atlas and Lily both live a life of abuse, both different kinds of abuse, but abuse nonetheless. As teenagers this pair were each other’s hope, each other’s rock and each other’s home, sadly of course things never turn out how we think it will and they are definitely in for a time of disappointment.  I think this storyline was told so well and after reading the authors notes at the end I can understand why.  Obviously the book wasn’t all about Lily and Atlas, we got to meet Alyssa and Marshall who were the sweetest couple ever.  Of course we then meet Ryle, Alyssa’s brother, there is a lot more to this guy than meets the eye, which is all I can say without spoiling too much.  Absolutely brilliant read that I wholeheartedly recommend.",1471156265,"<span>I put off reading this book for ages, it was in my house on the TBR pile but we all know that the TBR pile is like a big black hole!!!

R3LX4EVQ6Q5BHY,"This story of love, friendship, heartache, strength and hope is one I loved reading","I am giving ""It ends with us"" 5 amazing stars!!!  Colleen you've done it again!  We meet Lily at the age of 15, she becomes a lifeline to Atlas a young boy who has found himself homeless. Lily shows him kindness, love and hope when no one else did.  I fell in love with Lily, she was not only her mothers protector when her father became abusive but she became Atlas's Angel when life seemed to hard to go on.  Atlas, had nothing, other than the clothes on his back and his backpack he had nothing. He came to live in the deserted house behind Lily's home and it was at this point she saved him.  Lily meets Ryle once she's grown up, living in Boston. Their first meeting is unexpected but sets the path to their relationship. Months later, they meet again, there relationship blossoms and somehow even though they've had different ideas of what they want out of a relationship it seems to work well for both of them.  Lily meets Alyssa when she's starting her own business. Alyssa is a breath of fresh air and is just what Lily needs!

R166BNK2RYMJMZ,Heartbreaking,"This was heartbreaking to read. Lily grew up in an abusive household. Although he never touched her, her father beat her mother and Lily often put herself in between them. She couldn’t understand why her mother didn’t leave. Then she meets and falls in love with Ryle, and just when she thinks that she has everything she could wish for, he hits her. She has to decide if she can forgive him and move forward. And just to make matters more complicated, since running into her first love again unexpectedly, she can’t help wondering how things could have been different. This was such a hard read - what I thought to be so black and white has so many grey areas, and I ended up feeling torn by the decisions Lily makes and wishing things not to play out as they did! It also made me feel very grateful. I would recommend the read but it comes with a trigger warning.

Many of our irrational behaviors are caused by the fast response of system 1, together with the laziness of system 2. The second pair is Humans and Econs, which Econ means the rational assumption assumed by classic economists, and Human means the actual human in the daily life. The Prospect Theory is used explained in what kinds of situation that humans do not behave like economists have predicted, and why. The third pair is the experiencing self and remembering self.
